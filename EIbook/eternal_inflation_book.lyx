 After reviewing various existing approaches and mathematical techniques

 I give a detailed description of the new measure and its applications to
 generic models of eternal inflation of random-walk type and to landscape
 scenarios.
 The RV prescription is formulated differently for scenarios with eternal
 inflation of the random walk type and for landscape scenarios.
 For models of random-walk inflation, the RV cutoff considers events where
 one has a finite (although large) total reheating volume to the future
 of an initial Hubble patch.
 For landscape scenarios, I propose to calculate the distribution of observable
 quantities in a landscape that is conditioned in probability to nucleate
 a finite total number of bubbles to the future of an initial bubble.
 In each case I show in a mathematically rigorous manner that the RV measure
 yields well-defined results that are invariant with respect to general
 coordinate transformations, independent of the initial conditions at the
 beginning of inflation, and free of the

\begin_layout Standard
It is likely, given the present cosmological knowledge, that the universe
 may continue expanding forever and that local conditions in the universe
 are at least to some extent randomly produced.
 As a result, different and causally independent regions of the universe
 — that is to say, regions inaccessibly far removed from each other in space
 and time — may, by chance, acquire the hot homogeneous state (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hot Big Bang
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that is known to be the origin of our observed universe.
 It follows that, given unlimited time, the universe will generate an 
\emph on
infinite
\emph default
 number of regions similar to ours, where galaxies and stars may give rise
 to intelligent life capable of scientific observation.
 Each region where local conditions are approximately homogeneous is called
 a pocket universe

, while the totality of (infinitely many) pocket universes is called a multivers

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In almost all scenarios of multiverse cosmology (the most recent such scenario
 being the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

landscape
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of string theory vacua) it is virtually certain that the different pocket
 universes will have different physical properties, such as the observed
 values of physical constants, including the masses of elementary particles,
 the fine structure constant, and the effective value of the cosmological
 constant.
 Since our present location in the universe is (presumably) in no way special,
 it follows that the presently observed values of physical constants are
 randomly generated and cannot be predicted on the basis of a fundamental
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

theory of everything

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, the local values of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constants of nature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in each pocket universe are 
\emph on

 rather than manifestations of global underlying physical properties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A natural approach in this situation is to try predicting the probability
 distribution for the local values of physical constants observed in a randomly
 chosen pocket universe.
 This approach has been initiated in the late 1980s, and quite soon a difficulty
 (now known as the measure problem) presented itself.
 The root of the measure problem
\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
measure problem
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is the fact that it is impossible to compute statistical averages directly
 on the ensemble of infinitely many pocket universes.
 The notion of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

randomly chosen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pocket universe is mathematically ill-defined.
 One needs to introduce a cutoff on the infinite set of pocket universes;
 however, the results depend sensitively on the cutoff procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measure problem has resisted solution for more than two decades since
 its original formulation in the early 1990s, which was in the context of
 cosmological inflation driven by scalar fields.
 At present, the renewed interest in the measure problem is due to the discovery
 of inflationary models in the string-theoretic landscape, which allows
 a very large number of metastable vacua with different physical laws.
 The need to extract predictions from these models has stimulated significant
 research activity in this field, resulting in the appearance of several
 competing measure proposals and a deeper understanding of the issues involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book gives an overview of the presently known approaches to the measure
 problem and proceeds to describe a novel measure proposal, which was developed
 in a series of recent publications.
 Currently the measure problem in multiverse cosmology is an active area
 of research, and more progress may be achieved in the near future.
 Rather than trying to anticipate the forthcoming results, I wish to concentrate
 on the exposition of concepts and mathematical methods that will probably
 remain useful for future research in this area.
 I give merely a brief expository presentation of inflationary cosmology,
 referring the reader to numerous available textbooks for the needed background
 material.
 To recover the necessary background, the reader is only obliged to follow
 an introductory course in inflationary cosmology and cosmological perturbations.
 Similarly, I include only a necessary minimum of facts regarding the landscape
 of string theory; no knowledge of string theory is assumed or needed in
 this book.
 On the other hand, I show some derivations and illuminate details not ordinaril
y given in the literature on eternal inflation.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Cosmology is the branch of physics concerned with description of the universe
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

at large
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as manifested by large-scale astronomical observations.
 Since the discovery of the expansion of the universe by Hubble and the
 development of the general relativistic model of non-stationary homogeneous
 spacetime by Friedmann and others, the accepted point of view has been
 that the universe is expanding, and that in the distant past the state
 of the universe was extremely different from its present state.
 How the universe began (if it had a beginning) and how it evolved to its
 present condition are among the main questions modern cosmology aims to
 answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the goal of describing the entire universe might seem to require

 which may or may not be ever constructed but in any case is not presently
 available, it turns out that many important cosmological observations could
 be explained in the framework of currently available physical theories,
 in particular the known high-energy physics and classical gravity.
 Gamow and others introduced a model of the universe expanding from an extremely
 hot and dense state (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hot Big Bang
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 In what concerns the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, this
 scenario is in such good agreement with observations that it is now considered
 to be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standard cosmology.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, the standard cosmology leaves several important questions unanswered.
 For instance, in the Big Bang scenario one 
\emph on
assumes
\emph default
 rather than derives the initial state of the universe — a state characterized
 for instance by high temperature, homogeneity, and isotropy over extremely
 large length scales — and the origins of this highly fine-tuned initial
 state still need to be adequately explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is why one of the central problems of cosmology today is to describe
 the era 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the onset of the hot Big Bang scenario.
 Because of the present lack of detailed knowledge of high-energy physics
 and quantum gravity, and due to insufficient precision and scope of available
 astrophysical observations, numerous cosmological models of the very early
 universe compete on more or less equal footing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The scenario of inflation assumes an epoch of an extremely fast expansion
 (

 The resulting hot state becomes the starting point of the standard

\end_inset

 scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inflationary models have been extensively studied during the last three
 decades.
 It was found early on that in most inflationary models driven by scalar
 fields the process of inflation is strongly affected by quantum fluctuations,
 which may randomly postpone or advance the onset of reheating.
 One talks of a

\end_inset

 in order to describe the evolution of the scalar fields.
 In regions where reheating has been delayed, the exponential expansion
 continues and produces more inflating regions.
 As a result, the universe viewed at extremely large distance scales presents
 a mosaic of domains with dramatically different physical properties: Some
 regions have already thermalized and developed matter structures such as
 stars and galaxies, while other regions still undergo an inflationary expansion
 and are cold and empty.
 Thus, a radical departure from homogeneity can be expected at extremely
 large distances.
 Generically, at

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some models, the various thermalized regions may also differ from each
 other in observable cosmological parameters or even in values of the coupling
 constants observed in low-energy physics.
 There are two problems with such models: First, a model that allows a wide
 range of parameters to be observed in various regions of the universe has

 Different vacua have different values of the effective cosmological constant,
 coupling constants of low-energy physics, and particle masses.
 Transitions between these states are possible through bubble nucleation.
 The interior of each bubble appears to the interior observers as an infinite

 The presently observed universe is situated within a bubble whose vacuum

 One hopes that this procedure not only provides results that are in principle
 testable by observation, but also indirectly confirms the existence of
 the otherwise unobservable regions of space.
 This was the program outlined in those early works on eternal inflation.

\begin_layout Standard
However, one runs into an immediate difficulty when one tries to extract
 statistical predictions for cosmological observables in this setting.
 The difficulty is due to an infinite volume of regions where an observer
 may be located.
 Indeed, an eternally inflating universe contains an infinite, inhomogeneous,
 and topologically complicated spacelike hypersurface (the reheating surface)
 near which observers may be expected to appear with a constant density
 per unit 3-volume.
 Hence, the total number of observers in the universe is infinite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the landscape scenarios, one encounters a kind of infinity that is in
 some sense even more ill-behaved than in the random-walk inflationary scenarios.
 Not only each pocket universe may contain infinitely many observers, but
 also the number of different pocket universes in the entire spacetime is
 infinite.
 Pocket universes of different types are not statistically equivalent to
 each other because they have different rates of nucleation of other pocket
 universes as well as different interior physics.
 There seems to be no natural ordering on the set of all pocket universes
 throughout the spacetime, since most of the pocket universes are spacelike
 separated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both these contexts — random-walk models and the landscape models — one
 can view eternal inflation as a stochastic process that generates a topological
ly complicated and noncompact locus of points where observers may appear.
 A

 these proposals will be reviewed and their contrasting features will be
 characterized.
 Almost all of the existing prescriptions are based on cutting off the infinite
 volume of space by some geometric construction.
 Thus, one considers a 
\emph on
finite subset
\emph default
 of the total volume where observers may appear; the subset is characterized
 by a regulating parameter, such as the largest scale factor attained by
 the observers or another geometric parameter.
 Then one gathers statistics throughout the finite subset of the volume,
 and finally takes the limit as the regulating parameter tends to infinity.
 The limit usually exists and yields a certain probability distribution
 for cosmological observables.
 Unfortunately, it turned out that the limiting distribution depends sensitively
 on the choice of the regularizing procedure.
 Since a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mathematically consistent definition of the measure is absent, one needs
 to be open to different possibilities and try different measure prescriptions.
 A measure prescription can be judged as viable if its predictions are not
 obviously pathological.
 Possible pathologies include the dependence on choice of spacetime coordinates,
 the

 The new measures are not based on regulating the spacetime by any geometric
 construction but rather on manipulating the events in the probability space
 in order to obtain a well-defined sub-ensemble of finite multiverses.
 A finite multiverse can be generated by rare chance if inflation ends everywher
e; the probability of this event is small but nonzero.
 One can characterize the

e.g.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

by specifying the total volume of the reheating regions (which will be finite),
 the total number of nucleated bubbles, or another such number considered
 as a regulating parameter.
 In this way, one obtains a family of finite multiverses that in a well-defined
 sense approximate the actual, infinite multiverse as the regulating parameter
 tends to infinity.
 It is then expected that the probability distribution of any observable
 will tend to a well-defined limit.
 That limit is the prediction of the new measure.
\end_layout

I work out in detail the mathematical formalism necessary for computations
 in the new measure, both in the case of random-walk inflation (Chapter

 The computations turn out to be cumbersome since the possibility of creating
 a finite multiverse is difficult to describe explicitly, especially in
 the limit of a very large size of the finite multiverse.
 Nevertheless, it is possible to obtain direct results and general proofs
 for various properties of the new measure.
 This is achieved by different methods in random-walk eternal inflation
 and in landscape scenarios.
 In each case I derived explicit formulas for the predictions of the new
 measure so as to make the final computations more tractable if a specific
 model is given.

We begin with the story of inflation.
 While the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hot Big Bang
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cosmological scenario has been widely accepted after the detection of the
 cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and explanation of the nucleosynthe
sis, several poorly explained and contradictory facts remained.
 The main problems of the standard hot cosmology were the horizon problem
 and the flatness problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The horizon problem stems from the fact that the observed CMB is highly
 isotropic, with relative temperature variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 (see, 
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default
, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Smoot:1992td"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The CMB radiation is coming from the last scattering surface, which at
 the time of decoupling consisted of a large number of causally disconnected
 horizon-size regions, each region spanning about 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 of today's sky.
 However, observations of the high degree of homogeneity of the CMB temperature
 suggest that all these regions had had a nearly equal temperature at the
 time of last scattering.
 This absence of large-scale fluctuations is difficult to explain unless
 we assume rather unnatural-looking, extremely uniform initial conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flatness problem is also in a sense a problem of initial conditions:
 the universe must initially have been unnaturally close to flat.
 The density parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 evolves in such a way that any deviation from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=1$
\end_inset

 grows with time, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\Omega-1\right|\propto t^{2-\frac{4}{3\left(1+w\right)}}\propto a^{1+3w},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which can also be expressed through the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\Omega-1\right|\propto T^{-\left(1+3w\right)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 at present is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, it must have been extremely close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 at early times.
 For instance, at Planck temperatures 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\text{P}}\sim10^{19}$
\end_inset

 GeV with 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\text{now}}=3$
\end_inset

 K one obtains the estimate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\Omega_{P}-1\right|=\left|\Omega_{\text{now}}-1\right|\left(\frac{T_{\text{now}}}{T_{\text{P}}}\right)^{-2}\lesssim10^{-60}.\label{OmegaConstr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If one assumes a more natural initial condition for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, for example, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\sim1$
\end_inset

 at Planck time, then one finds that the universe would have either collapsed
 within a few Planck times if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega>1$

 A detailed review of inflationary models is beyond the scope of this work;

 models.

\begin_layout Standard
According to the standard results of Einstein's General Relativity, an accelerat
ed (inflationary) expansion can be supported only by an unusual kind of
 matter having an equation of state 
\begin_inset Formula $p<-\frac{1}{3}\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The only alternative to the presence of such matter is a modification of
 Einstein's theory.
 Since neither a detectable modification of the Einstein gravity nor any
 matter with the required equation of state has been found in experiments,
 a specific model of inflation necessarily hypothesizes either a new matter
 field or a modified theory of gravity that coincides with Einstein's in
 every respect except for the behavior of gravity during the inflationary
 epoch.
 We will not need to dwell on the details of model-building since the main
 topic of this book concerns features common to all inflationary models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first major type of inflationary models considered in this book is a
 class of models where the Hubble rate 
\begin_inset Formula $H(t)$
\end_inset

 is a smooth function of time.
 Initially 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is large although well below the Planck scale, 
\begin_inset Formula $H\ll1$
\end_inset

, in order to justify the use of classical gravity.
 The process of inflation ends when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 approaches zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to model such evolution is to assume that a scalar-field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 dominates the energy density of the universe and drives inflation.
 Such a field is called the

.
 We consider a prototypical model with the action 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S=\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{M_{\text{P}}^{2}}{16\pi}R+\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}-V\left(\phi\right)\right],
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 has canonical action with self-interaction potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 and is minimally coupled to the standard Einstein gravity.
 We will assume the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric ansatz,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=dt^{2}-a^{2}\left(t\right)\left[\frac{dr^{2}}{1-kr^{2}}+r^{2}d\theta^{2}+r^{2}\sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2}\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By using this ansatz we assume that the metric is spatially homogeneous
 with constant curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is then natural to assume that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is spatially homogeneous, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi(t)$
\end_inset

.
 One can then derive Einstein's equations of motion for the scale factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)$
\end_inset

 and the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot{a}^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{k}{a^{2}} & =\frac{8\pi}{3M_{\text{p}}^{2}}\left(V\left(\phi\right)+\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}\right),\label{SRField1}\\
\ddot{\phi}+3\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\dot{\phi} & =-\frac{dV\left(\phi\right)}{d\phi}.\label{SRField2}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Because of large value of the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, we can disregard the curvature term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k/a^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 in Eq.

 If the inflationary expansion history 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)$

 could be fully reconstructed from observations, that procedure would fix
 the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 However, it is impossible to observe directly the universe at times 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 corresponding to inflation because the exponential expansion pushes the
 relevant distances beyond the horizon.
 A reconstruction of the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 or of the expansion history 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)$
\end_inset

 can be performed only by observing the primordial cosmological perturbations,

 These equations can be rewritten as a single, nonlinear second-order equation

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since this equation does not contain

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\phi}\equiv v(\phi)$

An analysis of solutions of this equation shows, for a wide class of potentials
 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$

 with monotonic behavior at infinity, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^{n}$
\end_inset

 starting at large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_layout Standard
Since solutions approach an attractor curve exponentially quickly, we may
 disregard all other solutions except the attractor curve.

 (All such solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 differ only by the choice of the initial time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

.) We arrive at the picture that the inflationary process may have started
 in a generic initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\phi,\dot{\phi}\right)$
\end_inset

 in the phase plane of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 after a relatively short time.
 Thus, inflation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 its initial conditions; in order to study the inflationary evolution, it
 is sufficient to analyze the attractor solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 In effect, the two-dimensional phase space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\phi,\dot{\phi}\right)$
\end_inset

 is reduced to a one-dimensional line 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 along which the evolution of the field during inflation will proceed.
 In order to justify this picture, we only need to assume that inflation
 started with a large enough value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 while the initial value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is not exponentially large, which appears to be a reasonable assumption.

 It is known that the initial state suitable for inflation must have a sufficien

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 such that the potential energy

 dominates over any gradients or kinetic energy in

 Also, we will see below that eternal inflation mitigates the problem of

\begin_layout Standard
While an exact expression for the trajectory

\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$

 dominates over the kinetic energy, and the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 does not change appreciably on the Hubble time scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=H^{-1}\equiv a/\dot{a}$
\end_inset

 More precisely, one assumes that, on the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

, the following inequalities hold, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}\ll V\left(\phi\right),\quad\left|\ddot{\phi}\right|\ll\left|\frac{dV\left(\phi\right)}{d\phi}\right|,\label{SRConds0}

Until now we have been considering single-field models of inflation.
 This is the simplest possible class of models that can be adjusted to agree
 with the present cosmological observations.
 While the exact nature of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is still unknown (up to now, none of the observed fundamental elementary
 particles are scalar fields), the single-field model may be viewed as an
 adequate effective description of the yet unknown forces driving the inflationa
ry process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accommodate future observations, one may wish to have a more general
 model of inflation than a single canonical scalar field.
 Possible venues of generalization include models with several minimally
 coupled, canonical scalar fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{N}$
\end_inset

 and a potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi_{1},...,\phi_{N})$
\end_inset

, or non-canonical scalar fields such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S[\phi]=\int p({\textstyle \frac{1}{2}}\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2},\phi)\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p(X,\phi)$
\end_inset

 is a nonlinear function of the canonical kinetic term 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X\equiv\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}(\partial_{\mu}\phi)(\partial_{\nu}\phi).
\end{equation}

In models with several scalar fields and/or with noncanonical fields, the
 equations of motion are of course quite different.
 Nevertheless, the attractor behavior persists: the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2N\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional phase space of a model with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 scalar fields is effectively reduced to an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 An analog of the slow-roll approximation can be developed to approximate
 the attractor curves.
 There is generically an

The endpoint of inflation in multi-field models is the only information
 remaining from the initial conditions for inflation.
 As long as these initial conditions are unknown, there can be no definite
 prediction for the physical state at reheating.
 For instance, the reheating temperature or other cosmological parameters
 could depend on the values of the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 at reheating.
 In some models, the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi_{1},...,\phi_{N})$
\end_inset

 is arranged so that the set of the possible endpoints of inflation are
 limited to a relatively small region in field space.
 In that case, the physical state at the end of inflation is approximately
 independent of the initial conditions for inflation.

 One of the models proposed in

 had the effective potential 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

 has two minima corresponding to the false and true vacua, respectively
 (see Fig.

 While the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 stays in the false vacuum (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 to almost uniform (up to corrections due to tunneling, see section

 The field 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 has a small probability to tunnel to the true vacuum through the formation
 of bubbles which will have a continuous spectrum of initial values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 Inside a bubble, the potential becomes

 starts evolving from its initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$

 until thermalization in the global minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\sigma,\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 The novel feature of this model is that interiors of different bubbles
 will experience different amounts of inflation due to variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 at nucleation and, therefore, will have different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

Eternal inflation, or the property that inflation never ends in the whole
 spacetime, is a generic property of inflationary models.
 The mechanism of eternal inflation is based on the effect of quantum fluctuatio
ns on the average values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and on the metric in horizon-size volumes.
 This is essentially the same physical effect as that which is assumed to
 be responsible for generating the observed, 
\emph on
classical
\emph default
 cosmological perturbations out of 
\emph on
quantum
\emph default
 fluctuations in the vacuum state.

The classical evolution of the field

 (neglecting quantum fluctuations) is described by Eq.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "IntroSlowRoll"

\end_inset

).
 However, in the de Sitter space the behavior of quantum fluctuations of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 depends crucially on whether their wavelength is above or below the horizon
 size.
 The evolution of the super-horizon scale fluctuations is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frozen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and they are measured by observers inside a horizon-sized region as classical
 corrections to the average value of the field in the region.
 With the expansion of space, quantum fluctuations with sub-horizon wavelengths
 are stretched to super-horizon scales and shift the average field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi\sim H/\left(2\pi\right)$
\end_inset

While the fluctuations of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 have ultimately quantum origin, their semi-classical character leads, through
 coupling to classical gravity, to the consequence that the local expansion
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{a}/a\equiv H(\phi)$
\end_inset

 tracks the local value of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t,\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 according to the Einstein equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t,\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is the scale factor function that varies with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 only on superhorizon scales, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Delta x\right|\gtrsim a^{-1}H^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the spacetime can be visualized as having a slowly varying, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 metric, written in spatially flat coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}=dt^{2}-a^{2}(t,\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}^{2}.\label{eq:locally de Sitter}

\end_inset

 This picture requires that the metric remains everywhere 
\emph on
classical
\emph default
 despite the fact that it is 
\emph on

 fluctuations that generate the inhomogeneity of the metric.
 It is assumed, in effect, that quantum fluctuations of the metric become
 classical metric perturbations when their wavelength significantly exceeds
 the horizon size.
 This assumption is not yet theoretically justified in a completely explicit
 manner and is still a subject of active research.
 Further discussion of this issue is given below in Sec.

 Presently, let us emphasize that the same assumption — that of classicality
 of superhorizon-scale metric fluctuations resulting from quantum field
 fluctuations — is at the foundation of the accepted and experimentally
 successful theory of inflation-generated cosmological perturbations (see,
 for instance, the textbooks

\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{sr}}(t)$
\end_inset

 and a Brownian motion driven by quantum fluctuations.
 The deterministic trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{sr}}(t)$
\end_inset

 eventually reaches the reheating boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 where the slow-roll inflationary regime ends and the reheating epoch (thermaliz

 Note that fluctuations are very small (of order 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

) within 60 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings before reheating, hence the trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 is very close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{sr}}(t)$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

 However, far away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 the trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 can fluctuate significantly, and the fluctuations are space-dependent.
 Thus different comoving points may reach the reheating regime 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

 at significantly different times, or may instead reach the Planck boundary
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{P}}$

 One possibility is to discard the regions reaching the Planck boundary
 since they presumably have an essentially quantum (not semiclassical) state
 of the metric and thus cannot be interpreted as regions of a classical
 spacetime.
 Another possibility is to introduce an artificial reflecting boundary,
 modifying the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{\text{P}}$
\end_inset

 such that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is reflected away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{P}$
\end_inset

 without reaching the Planck boundary.
 In either case, one essentially obtains the situation in which the Planck
 boundary is never reached, so that the evolution 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 at any point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 definitely (with probability 1) reaches the reheating boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

\begin_layout Standard
Even though any given comoving point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 will eventually enter a thermalized region, the global behavior of the
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is different.
 Since the random walk process will lead the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 in some regions, reheating will not begin everywhere at the same time.
 Moreover, regions where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 remains in the inflationary range will typically expand faster than regions
 near the end of inflation.
 Therefore, a delay of the onset of reheating will be rewarded by additional
 expansion of the 3-volume, thus generating proportionally more regions
 that are still inflating.
 Since each Hubble-size region evolves independently of other such regions,
 one may visualize the spacetime as an ensemble of inflating Hubble-size
 domains (Fig.

 As a result of self-reproduction, the volume of the inflating domain grows
 exponentially with time, even though any given co-moving point will eventually
 enter a thermalized region.
 This feature of self-reproduction helps solve the problem of initial conditions
 for inflation: Wherever a self-reproducing region is formed, its inflating
 offspring dominates the physical volume at fixed proper time, and all other
 regions (including those with initial conditions unsuitable for inflation)
 will occupy an exponentially small fraction of the total volume.

 Indeed, one may choose coordinates in which the volume of the inflating

Since the values of the observable parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 are random, it is natural to ask for the probability distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 that would be measured by a randomly chosen observer.
 Understandably, this question has been the main theme of much of the work
 on eternal inflation.
 Obtaining an answer to this question promises to establish a more direct
 contact between scenarios of eternal inflation and experiment.
 For instance, if the probability distribution for the cosmological constant
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 were peaked near the experimentally observed, puzzlingly small value (see

 for a review of the cosmological constant problem), the smallness of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 would be explained as due to observer selection effects rather than to
 fundamental physics.
 Considerations of this sort necessarily involve some anthropic reasoning;
 however, the relevant assumptions are minimal.
 The basic goal of theoretical cosmology is to select physical theories
 of the early universe that are most compatible with astrophysical observations,
 including the observation of our existence.
 It appears reasonable to assume that the civilization of Planet Earth evolved
 near a randomly chosen star compatible with the development of life, within
 a randomly chosen galaxy where such stars exist.
 Many models of inflation generically include eternal inflation and hence
 predict the formation of infinitely many galaxies where civilizations like
 ours may develop.
 It is then also reasonable to assume that our civilization is typical among
 all the civilizations that evolved in galaxies formed at any time anywhere
 in the universe.
 This assumption is called the

 In the example with the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 described above, the question is to determine the probability distribution
 for the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 that a random observer will measure.
 Presumably, the values of the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 do not directly influence the emergence of intelligent life on planets,
 although they may affect the efficiency of structure formation or nucleosynthes

 Therefore, we may assume a fixed,

 of suitable galaxies per unit volume in a region where reheating occurred
 with given values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

; in any case, this task does not appear to pose difficulties of principle.
 Then the computation of

 is reduced to determining the volume-weighted probability distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}(\chi_{a})$
\end_inset

 for the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 within a randomly chosen 3-volume along the reheating surface.
 The probability distribution of

 will be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\chi_{a})=\mathcal{V}(\chi_{a})\nu_{G}(\chi_{a})\nu_{\text{civ}}(\chi_{a}).\label{eq:probability}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

However, defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}(\chi_{a})$
\end_inset

 turns out to be far from straightforward since the reheating surface in
 eternal inflation is an infinite 3-surface with a complicated geometry
 and topology.
 The lack of a natural, unambiguous, unbiased measure on the infinite reheating
 surface is known as the measure problem in eternal inflation.

The salient features of random walk type eternal inflation can be understood
 by considering a simple slow-roll inflationary model with a single scalar
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 and a potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 The slow-roll evolution equation is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi}=-\frac{1}{3H}\frac{dV}{d\phi}=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{dH}{d\phi}\equiv v(\phi),\label{eq:v def 1}

 If a higher precision is desired, we may use the exact attractor curve

, the super-horizon modes of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 are assumed to undergo a rapid quantum-to-classical transition.

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 on scales of several 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{-1}$

An explicit form of the correlator

 However, the window function 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is merely a phenomenological device used in lieu of a complete

 derivation of the stochastic inflation picture.
 One expects, therefore, that results of calculations should be robust with
 respect to the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, any uncertainty due to the choice of the window function
 must be regarded as an imprecision inherent in the method.
 For instance, a robust result in this sense is an exponentially fast decay
 of correlations on time scales 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gtrsim H^{-1}$

\begin_inset Formula

As usual in kinetic theory, we disregard higher-order terms in

 Now we use the property

\begin{equation}
P(\phi_{1},\phi_{2},t,t)=\delta(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2})

 Although the stochastic differential equation appears to describe fluctuations

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gtrsim H^{-1}$

 Accordingly, the Langevin and the FP equations can be used only to describe
 features of the distribution at time scales at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gtrsim H^{-1}$

 It is, however, technically more convenient to consider continuous-time
 Brownian motion with infinitesimal steps, using either Langevin or FP equations.
 It is sufficient that these equations reproduce correct results for steps
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\gtrsim H^{-1}$

 In order to quantify this artificial distinction between continuous and
 discrete Brownian motion, we may introduce a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=\left(\varepsilon H\right)^{-1}$

 We find by examining the derivation of the FP equation that the resulting

 For this reason, we conclude that a description in terms of the finite-differen

\end{equation}

These boundary conditions express the fact that random jumps are very small
 at the end of inflation and cannot move the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Another, simpler possibility is to impose the absorbing boundary condition,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi_{*},t)=0$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually the case that the solutions of the FP equations are insensitive
 to the precise choice of the boundary conditions at the reheating boundary.
 While a different choice of boundary conditions will distort the solution
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,t)$
\end_inset

 near the boundary points, this distortion is negligible away from these
 points

 One can consider a replacement of the form

 For instance, a possible choice is 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\phi)\equiv H(\phi)$

 The comoving FP equation is
\begin_inset Formula

\partial_{\tau}P_{V}=\partial_{\phi\phi}\left[\frac{D}{H}P_{V}\right]-\partial_{\phi}\left[\frac{v}{H}P_{V}\right]+3P_{V}.\label{eq:FP V efolding}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is important to note that these two equations are essentially equivalent:
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$

 is a solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

 This equivalence is easily understood: The volume-weighted distribution
 on surfaces of equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 since the growth of volume along a surface of equal scale factor is everywhere
 the same by construction.
 However, comoving and volume-weighted distributions in other time gauges
 are not equivalent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing the time gauge may significantly alter the qualitative behavior
 of the solutions of the FP equations.
 For instance, stationary distributions defined through the proper time

 This sensitivity to the choice of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

time gauge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is unavoidable since hypersurfaces of equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 may preferentially select regions with certain properties.
 It is easy to see that most of the physical volume in equal-
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 hypersurfaces is filled with regions that have gained expansion by remaining
 near the top of the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

, while hypersurfaces of equal scale factor will instead under-represent
 those regions.
 Thus, a statement such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

most of the volume in the universe has values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 with high 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is largely gauge-

 This is to be expected since the FP equation describes the distribution
 of properties along equal-

\end_inset

 hypersurfaces, while these hypersurfaces defined for different time gauges
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 are not statistically equivalent but differ from each other in a systematic
 way.
 Hence, as a rule, any solution or any property of the FP equation is gauge-depe

 Exceptions are found only when one considers some results obtained by solving

Although the FP equations necessarily involve a dependence on gauge, they

 The FP techniques can also be used for deriving several gauge-independent

 statement (see also Sec.

 Presently we will show how to determine the exit probabilities

 Let us assume for simplicity that there are two possible exit points 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{E}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\phi,t=0)=\delta(\phi-\phi_{0}),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{E}<\phi_{0}<\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we are considering the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,t)$
\end_inset

 along a single comoving worldline, the appropriate FP equation is Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 This equation can be rewritten as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

conservation law,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{t}P=\partial_{\phi}J,\quad J(\phi)\equiv\partial_{\phi}(DP)-vP,\label{eq:cons law}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Using the conservation law
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), one finds that the probability of exiting inflation through 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{E}$
\end_inset

 during a time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[t,t+dt]$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
dp_{\text{exit}}(\phi_{E}) & =J(\phi_{E})dt\equiv\left.\left(\partial_{\phi}\left(DP\right)-vP\right)\right|_{\phi=\phi_{E}}dt\nonumber \\
 & =-v(\phi_{E})P(\phi_{E},t)dt.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\phi_{E})<0$
\end_inset

 and we used the boundary condition
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 Hence, the total probability of exiting through 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{E}$
\end_inset

 at any time is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{\textrm{exit}}(\phi_{E})=\int_{0}^{\infty}dp_{\text{exit}}(\phi_{E})=-v(\phi_{E})\int_{0}^{\infty}P(\phi_{E},t)dt.

Introducing an auxiliary function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\phi)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(\phi)\equiv-v(\phi)\int_{0}^{\infty}P(\phi,t)dt,

(

\partial_{\phi}\left[\partial_{\phi}\left(\frac{D}{v}F\right)-F\right]=\delta(\phi-\phi_{0}).\label{eq:for p exit}

This is in accord with the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\textrm{exit}}(\phi_{E})=F(\phi_{E})$

 The exit probability

In the same way one can try to use the volume distribution

However, one generally finds that

The consideration of the exit probability can motivate the choice of the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Namely, it can be shown that only the Ito factor ordering gives gauge-independe
nt results when one computes the exit probability.
 An arbitrary factor ordering can be described by introducing a parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and by replacing
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\phi\phi}(DP)\rightarrow\partial_{\phi}(D^{\theta}\partial_{\phi}(D^{1-\theta}P))
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in the FP equation.
 With an arbitrary gauge, 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tau\equiv Tdt$
\end_inset

, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $D,v$
\end_inset

 are replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $D/T,v/T$
\end_inset

 and so Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\phi}\left[\left(\frac{D}{T}\right)^{\theta}\partial_{\phi}\left(\left(\frac{D}{T}\right)^{1-\theta}\frac{T}{v}F\right)-F\right]=\delta(\phi-\phi_{0}).

Now it is clear that the above equation depends on

\begin_inset Formula $\theta\neq0$

 However, we expect that the exit probability is gauge-independent since
 it is defined as the probability of finishing inflation at a given value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 for a randomly chosen comoving observer, which is clearly independent of
 the choice of coordinates.

The Langevin and the Fokker–Planck equations are, in principle, equivalent
 descriptions of the same stochastic process, and we will focus on the FP
 description because it is more convenient to work with.
 It is important to note also that the boundary conditions (at the reheating

 but cannot be easily described in the framework of the Langevin equation.

 I would like to emphasize that this equation,
\begin_inset Formula

 As is well known, the backward diffusion equation is ill-defined because
 of instabilities; an arbitrarily small uncertainty in the fixed future
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{f}$

 will lead to an arbitrarily large variation in the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 Therefore, one cannot actually solve the backward FP equation in a directly

 One must always solve the

The equivalence of these interpretations can be seen from the following
 argument.
 Consider a large but finite domain of volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 within the hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

 and a very dense grid of comoving trajectories starting out from this domain.
 The total number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of these trajectories may be chosen as finite but very large, and the initial
 volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 can be subdivided into 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tiny regions of comoving volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}/N$
\end_inset

 situated around each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 comoving lines.
 If the initial volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large so that all the statistically possible histories
 are sufficiently well sampled, then the number of lines that reach a value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is very close to 
\begin_inset Formula $NP(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the comoving volume of the subdomain of the equal-
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 hypersurface having the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore in the statistical limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, the fraction of the comoving volume containing the field value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at the time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, if 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the statistical distribution of the comoving volume along an equal-
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 hypersurface, then the comoving volume of the subdomain with the value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 We denote this subdomain by 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 and consider a comoving trajectory randomly chosen from the total comoving
 volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The probability of this trajectory passing through the subdomain 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}P(\phi,\tau)/V_{0}=P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of the field having the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 along a randomly chosen trajectory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that there 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 exist correlations between the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at nearby comoving trajectories.
 However, these correlations are not reflected by the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 since it specifies only the total volume, but not the location, of regions
 with the field value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 If the initial comoving volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large (many Hubble volumes), the distribution of the field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 along a randomly chosen comoving trajectory will be 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 despite the correlations between nearby trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning now to the distribution of the physical volume 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

, we note that there is now only one interpretation, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the total proper 3-volume of the subdomain with the field value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 within an equal-
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 hypersurface.
 (As before, we consider only the comoving future of a large but finite
 initial volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

.) It appears to be impossible to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 directly in terms of observations made on a single randomly chosen comoving
 trajectory.
 The distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}(\phi,\tau)$
\end_inset

 describes a branching diffusion process with a possibly unlimited growth,
 and its interpretation necessarily has to involve a potentially very large
 ensemble of trajectories.

 The path integral is used to describe Brownian random walk, as is standard

 While the description of Brownian motion in terms of path integrals is
 entirely equivalent to that by FP equations, some aspects of the evolution

 One can compute the saddle point approximation to the path integral in

 It has been shown that the most likely trajectories during eternal inflation
 spend a long time in fluctuation-dominated regime and subsequently quickly
 reach reheating.

Another, equivalent way to make the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 self-adjoint without changing variables is to introduce the scalar product
\begin_inset Formula

\left\langle f_{1},f_{2}\right\rangle =\int f_{1}(\phi)f_{2}(\phi)M(\phi)d\phi,

One can then verify that the operator

 is formally self-adjoint with this scalar product,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle f_{1},\hat{L}^{\dagger}f_{2}\rangle=\langle\hat{L}^{\dagger}f_{1},f_{2}\rangle.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This points to another way of showing that the spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar considerations apply to the volume-weighted distribution

\begin{equation}
[\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3H(\phi)]P_{V}^{(\tilde{\lambda})}(\phi)=\tilde{\lambda}P_{V}^{(\tilde{\lambda})}(\phi).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

By the same method as for the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, it is possible to show that the spectrum of eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3H(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above and that the largest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\lambda}_{\max}\equiv\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 admits a nondegenerate, everywhere positive eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi)$

 However, the largest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 may be either positive or negative.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}>0$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{V}(\phi,t)\propto P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi)e^{\tilde{\gamma}t},\label{eq:late-time V}

\end_inset

which means that the total physical volume of all the inflating regions
 grows with time.
 This is the behavior expected in eternal inflation: the number of independently
 inflating domains increases without limit.
 Thus, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}>0$
\end_inset

 is a criterion for the presence of eternal self-reproduction of inflating

One important approximation applies to the evolution in the deterministic

which may be solved by the method of characteristics.
 Let us consider the corresponding time-independent FP equation,

 Hence we may write approximately
\begin_inset Formula

An analogous approximation for the deterministic regime can be developed
 also in the FP formalism, whose advantage over the Langevin description
 is that the boundary conditions as well as volume weighting can be taken
 into account.
 One notes that Eq.

\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) in the deterministic regime contains a small parameter (which is not the
 same as the slow-roll parameter), 
\begin_inset Formula $DH/v^{2}\ll1$
\end_inset

, and that the small parameter multiplies the highest-derivative term in
 that equation.
 Therefore, a WKB-like asymptotic perturbation theory can be applied.
 We will illustrate this technique by computing the volume-weighted average
 of the traversal time 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle t(\phi_{*})-t(\phi_{q})\right\rangle _{V}$
\end_inset

 spent in the deterministic regime, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{q}$

 is the reheating boundary.

For definiteness we assume that

 Since we are interested in describing the evolution only within the range

 where self-reproduction is absent, we may impose boundary conditions at
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{q}$

While these boundary conditions will distort the solution

 Let us consider the Green's function

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.G(\phi,\phi_{0},t)\right|_{t=0}=\delta(\phi-\phi_{0}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\phi,\phi_{0},t)$
\end_inset

 can be visualized as the time-dependent volume distribution that results
 from an initial unit volume with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $t=0$

 For the purposes of the present calculation we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{q}$

 The infinitesimal probability of reaching 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

Additionally, we need to take into account that new regions are continuously

\end_layout

\end_inset

We can calculate the infinitesimal probability of reaching 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 within the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t,t+dt\right]$
\end_inset

 when starting within the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t_{0},t_{0}+dt_{0}\right]$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v(\phi_{*})G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},t-t_{0})dt\,dt_{0}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus, the average traversal time for regions that reached 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 within the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[t,t+dt\right]$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta t\right\rangle =\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{t}dt_{0}\left(t-t_{0}\right)v(\phi_{*})G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},t-t_{0})}{\int_{-\infty}^{t}dt_{0}v(\phi_{*})G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},t-t_{0})}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The mean traversal time (which we have denoted for brevity by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \Delta t\right\rangle $
\end_inset

) is actually independent of the arrival time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 because, after the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}\equiv t-t_{0}$
\end_inset

, it can be identically rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta t\right\rangle =\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\tilde{t}d\tilde{t}\,G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},\tilde{t})}{\int_{0}^{\infty}d\tilde{t}\,G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},\tilde{t})}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 It is convenient to introduce the Laplace transform of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(\phi,\phi_{0};\omega)\equiv\int_{0}^{\infty}d\tilde{t}\,G(\phi,\phi_{0},\tilde{t})e^{-\omega\tilde{t}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then the expectation value of the traversal time is found as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta t\right\rangle =-\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\omega}\right|_{\omega=0}\ln g(\phi_{*},\phi_{0};\omega).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be also used to estimate the spread of the traversal time,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \Delta t^{2}\right\rangle -\left\langle \Delta t\right\rangle ^{2}=\left.\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\omega^{2}}\right|_{\omega=0}\ln g(\phi_{*},\phi_{0};\omega).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 By integrating Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(

\begin_inset Formula $g(\phi;\omega)$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\phi\phi}\left(Dg\right)-\partial_{\phi}\left(vg\right)+\left(3H-\omega\right)g=-\delta(\phi-\phi_{0}).\label{eq:g equ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation is valid as long as the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\infty}G(\phi_{*},\phi_{0},t)e^{-\omega t}dt$
\end_inset

 converges, which is expected to be the case at least for all positive 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 since the range 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\phi_{q},\phi_{*}\right]$
\end_inset

 does not support self-reproduction.

 To obtain an analytic formula for

\begin_inset Formula

 of random-walk type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hallmark of eternal inflation is the unbounded growth the total number
 of independent inflating regions.
 The total proper 3-volume of the inflating domain also grows without bound
 at late times, at least when computed along hypersurfaces of equal proper
 time or equal scale factor.
 However, the proper 3-volume is a gauge-dependent quantity, and one may
 construct complete spacelike foliations whose 3-volume decreases with time
 even in an everywhere expanding universe
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Clearly, the volume growth computed using an 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default
 family of equal-time hypersurfaces cannot be used as a criterion for the
 presence of eternal inflation.
 However, a weaker condition is adequate: Eternal inflation is present if
 and only if there 
\emph on
exists
\emph default
 a choice of time slicing with an unbounded growth of the 3-volume of inflating
 domains.

 Thus, the presence or absence of eternal inflation is a gauge-

 statement.
 One may, of course, use a particular gauge (such as the proper time or

\end_inset

-folding time) for calculations, since the result is known to be gauge-independe
nt.
 For instance, it can be shown that eternal inflation is present if and

Another way to formulate the condition for the presence of eternal inflation
 is that an infinite number of reheated 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions may result from 
\emph on
finitely
\emph default
 many initially inflating 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions.
 It is then clear that the initial conditions for inflation cease to play
 a significant role in the resulting universe.
 As long as the spacetime contains even a single 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region that supports inflation, no matter how unlikely it is to realize
 the favorable initial conditions for inflation, an 
\emph on
infinite
\emph default
 number of reheated (and potentially inhabitable) 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions will be created to the future of the initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region.
 Assuming that there is a finite nonzero probability for the emergence of
 life in any reheated 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region, it follows that eternal inflation generates an infinite number
 of regions containing life.
 A non-inflating initial region in the spacetime will give rise at most
 to a finite number of inhabitable regions.
 In this sense, it may be said that the inhabitable parts of the universe
 are dominated by the products of eternal inflation, and that eternal inflation
 removes the problem of fine-tuning of the initial conditions for inflation.

 It is normally sufficient to establish the existence of a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=H^{-1}$

 For models of scalar-field inflation, this condition is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Such a range of

 If, on the other hand, eternal inflation has been realized, then for an
 arbitrarily late time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 there will be regions that are still inflating at that time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case, there must exist some comoving worldlines that never enter
 a thermalized domain.
 To demonstrate this, one could choose a monotonically increasing sequence
 of time instances, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}=nH^{-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0,1,2,...$
\end_inset

; for each 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 there must exist a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 surrounded by a horizon-sized domain that will be still inflating at time
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 (As 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 grows, these domains become progressively smaller in comoving coordinates,
 due to expansion of space.) An infinite sequence of points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 on a finite (compact) comoving volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

-dimensional space must have accumulation points, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

there must be at least one point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 such that any arbitrarily small (comoving) neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 contains infinitely many points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 from the sequence.
 It is clear that the comoving world-line at an accumulation point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 cannot reach thermalization at any finite time: if it did, there would
 exist a comoving neighborhood around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 which thermalized at that time, and this contradicts the construction of
 the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, accumulation points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 are eternal points, and we may define the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 of all such points, as a set drawn on the spatial section of the comoving
 volume at initial time.
 (One could also imagine an infinitely dense grid of comoving world-lines
 starting at the initial surface, with the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 consisting of all world-lines that never reach thermalization.) As we have
 shown, eternal points exist, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 for a comoving region is not empty, if eternal inflation has been realized
 in that region.
 However, it is important to note that the 3-volume of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is equal to zero (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 This is the same as to say that a randomly chosen point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 will reach reheating with probability 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different histories and different choices of the initial comoving volume
 will generate different sets 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is a stochastically generated set, one may characterize it probabilistically,
 by finding probabilities for the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 to have certain properties.
 The underlying stochastic process is the random walk of the inflaton 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and, since it is a stationary stochastic process that does not explicitly
 depend on time, probabilities of any properties of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 depend only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, below we will denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

 the probability of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 being non-empty if the initial comoving 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region has a given value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$

\begin_layout Standard
During stochastic evolution, there will be (infinitely many) times when

\begin_inset Formula $E$

 The Cantor set is constructed by starting from a line segment, say

 Regions between eternal points are reheated.
 Assuming for simplicity that reheated regions become asymptotically flat

 If eternal points are sufficiently dense so that they form a continuous

 even though the set of eternal points is fractal), the reheated region
 will be forever causally separated from all other reheated regions.

with zero boundary conditions, 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 at the reheating boundary and 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi_{\text{P}}=0)$
\end_inset

 at the Planck boundary (if any).
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{L}_{\phi}\equiv D(\phi)\partial_{\phi\phi}+v(\phi)\partial_{\phi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 is the Fokker–Planck operator used in the 
\emph on

 FP equation.
 Note that Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is of reaction-diffusion type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We remark that 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi)\equiv0$
\end_inset

 is trivially a solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:X equ 00"

\end_inset

).
 However, this solution is not physically relevant if eternal inflation
 is present, since in that case the probability of having eternal points
 is certainly nonzero.
 As will be demonstrated below, the presence of eternal inflation is 
\emph on
equivalent
\emph default
 to the existence of a nontrivial solution 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi)\not\equiv0$
\end_inset

 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 We will begin by deriving that equation and showing its independence of
 time parametrization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be convenient to work with the complementary probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}\left(\phi\right)=1-X\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 and to use the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as the time variable.
 We recall that the random walk of the inflaton field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is described by a Langevin equation which can be written as a difference
 equation
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

 gives rise to independent random walks of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 in each of the

\end_inset

, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N\equiv\exp\left(3H\Delta t\right)\approx20$
\end_inset

 daughter subdomains of approximately horizon size.
 The stochastic process corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 assigns a probability density 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\xi_{1},...,\xi_{N}\right)d\xi_{1}...d\xi_{N}$
\end_inset

 for various sets of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{i}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}(\phi_{0})$

 of having 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 eternal points in the region is equal to the probability of having no eternal
 points in any of its 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 daughter subdomains.
 The evolution in inflating daughter subdomains proceeds independently,
 so the probability of having no eternal points in each of them is described
 by the same function 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 evaluated at new values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(t+\Delta t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 (Although the daughter subdomains have slightly varying 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 and are not exactly of horizon size, the correction due to this is negligible.)
 This argument gives an integral equation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \bar{X}\left(\phi_{0}\right)=\int d\xi_{1}...d\xi_{N}P\left(\xi_{1},...,\xi_{N}\right)\nonumber \\
 & \times\prod_{i=1}^{N}\bar{X}\left(\phi_{0}+v\left(\phi_{0}\right)\Delta t+\xi_{i}\sqrt{2D\left(\phi_{0}\right)\Delta t}\right).\label{eq:xd1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here we use the Ito interpretation of the Langevin equation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are evaluated at the initial point of the step, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since correlations between different daughter subdomains are small, we can
 approximate the probability density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{i}$
\end_inset

 by a product of independent identical distributions, 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\xi_{1},...,\xi_{N}\right)=P\left(\xi_{1}\right)\cdots P\left(\xi_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 Then Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Rather than trying to solve Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:xd2"

\end_inset

), we consider its limit for small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $H\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 Although the Langevin description of the random walk given by Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lang"

\end_inset

) is valid only for times 
\begin_inset Formula $H\Delta t\gtrsim1$
\end_inset

, we will formally consider it to be valid at all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 and take a partial derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial\Delta t$
\end_inset

 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=0$
\end_inset

.
 The same formal limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 is used to derive the FP equations in the stochastic approach of inflation,
 and the same limits of validity apply to the new nonlinear diffusion equation
 that will result from the present argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\bar{X}\left(\phi_{0}\right)}{\partial\Delta t} & =0=3H\bar{X}\ln\bar{X}\nonumber \\
 & +\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\int d\xi P\left(\xi\right)\frac{d\bar{X}\left(\phi_{0}+v\Delta t+\xi\sqrt{2D\Delta t}\right)}{d\phi}\nonumber \\
 & \times\left(v+\frac{\xi\sqrt{2D}}{2\sqrt{\Delta t}}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

We now expand 
\begin_inset Formula $d\bar{X}/d\phi$
\end_inset

 in Taylor series around 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 and use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int d\xi P\left(\xi\right)=1,\quad\left\langle \xi\right\rangle =0,\quad\left\langle \xi^{2}\right\rangle =1,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to obtain an equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D\frac{d^{2}\bar{X}}{d\phi^{2}}+v\frac{d\bar{X}}{d\phi}+3H\bar{X}\ln\bar{X}=0.\label{eq:Xequ}

This equation needs to be supplemented with suitable boundary conditions
 at end of inflation and/or at Planck boundaries.
 For a region which is near the end of inflation 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi_{*})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Domains reaching Planck boundaries 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{P}}$
\end_inset

 disappear from consideration, so we may assume that they will not contain
 eternal points and set 
\begin_inset Formula $X=0$
\end_inset

 at those boundaries.
 Physically meaningful solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi)$
\end_inset

 have the meaning of probability and so should vary between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the additional requirements are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 A change of time variable,

 This feature is to be expected since the probability

The existence of solutions of nonlinear equations

 However, there is a connection between solutions of such nonlinear equations
 and solutions of the linearized equations.
 Rigorous results are available in the mathematical literature on nonlinear
 functional analysis and bifurcation theory.
 In this and the following sections we will present the techniques that
 can be applied to Eq.

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

We begin with a heuristic argument; a rigorous demonstration will follow.
 Let us consider the situation when eternal inflation is barely allowed.
 One will then expect that the probability of having eternal points is very
 small, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

there exists a nontrivial solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:X equ phi 01"

\end_inset

) that approximately satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}(\phi)\approx1$
\end_inset

.
 The solution can be linearized in the neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}\approx1$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}=1-\chi(\phi)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(\phi)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the linear FP equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\hat{L}+3\right]\chi=0,\quad\hat{L}\equiv\frac{D}{H}\partial_{\phi\phi}+\frac{v}{H}\partial_{\phi}.\label{eq:chi equ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The FP operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3$
\end_inset

 is adjoint to the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3\right]P\equiv\partial_{\phi\phi}\left(\frac{D}{H}P\right)-\partial_{\phi}(\frac{v}{H}P)+3P,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which enters the FP equation for the 3-volume distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi,t)$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-folding time parametrization.
 If eternal inflation is allowed in a given model, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3$
\end_inset

 has a positive eigenvalue.
 The largest eigenvalue of that operator is zero in the borderline case
 when eternal inflation is just about to set in.
 The spectrum of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3$
\end_inset

 is the same as that of the adjoint operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, in the borderline case the largest eigenvalue of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3$
\end_inset

 will be zero, and there will exist a nontrivial, everywhere nonnegative
 solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

(

 Thus, heuristically one can expect that a nontrivial solution

We assume that

 is a nontrivial solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:X equ phi 01"

\end_inset

).
 The spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above, and there exists an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}^{\dagger}\psi=\gamma\psi$
\end_inset

 with zero boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi_{1})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi_{2})=0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is the largest eigenvalue.
 We need to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma>0$
\end_inset

.
 It is known that the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is everywhere positive, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi)>0$
\end_inset

, as a ground state of a self-adjoint operator.
 Then the following integral must be positive, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{1}\equiv\int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\left(1-\bar{X}\left(\phi\right)\right)\psi\left(\phi\right)d\phi>0.

\end_inset

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are left and right boundaries, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}>\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Since
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\gamma=\frac{1}{I_{1}}\int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\left(1-\bar{X}\right)[\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3]\psi\,d\phi,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

we would obtain the desired inequality 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma>0$
\end_inset

 if we prove that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{2}\equiv\int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\left(1-\bar{X}\right)[\hat{L}^{\dagger}+3]\psi\,d\phi>0.\label{eq:hitr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Integrating Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}\left(\phi_{1,2}\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi_{1,2})=0$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
I_{2} & =\int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\psi\,[\hat{L}+3]\left(1-\bar{X}\right)d\phi+\left.D\left(\phi\right)\psi\frac{d\bar{X}}{d\phi}\right|_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\nonumber \\
 & =\int_{\phi_{1}}^{\phi_{2}}\psi\,[\hat{L}+3]\left(1-\bar{X}\right)d\phi.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:X equ phi 01"

\end_inset

), we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & [\hat{L}+3]\left(1-\bar{X}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =-\frac{D}{H}\bar{X}_{,\phi\phi}-\frac{v}{H}\bar{X}_{,\phi}+3\left(1-\bar{X}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =3\left(1-\bar{X}+\bar{X}\ln\bar{X}\right)\geq0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

It follows that the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\psi\,[\hat{L}+3]\left(1-\bar{X}\right)d\phi$
\end_inset

 is positive: its integrand is nonnegative and not everywhere zero.
 This proves Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 must be positive.
 This concludes the proof of the necessary condition.

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In principle, the eigenvalue of

 with zero boundary conditions is not the same as the eigenvalue of the
 same operator with the boundary conditions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(

\end_inset

 One can have a borderline case when one of these two eigenvalues is positive
 while the other is negative.
 In this case, the two criteria for the presence of eternal inflation (based
 on the positivity of the two different eigenvalues) will disagree.
 However, the alternative boundary conditions are imposed at reheating,
 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

in the regime of very small fluctuations where the value of the eigenfunction
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is exponentially small compared with its values in the fluctuation-dominated
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the difference between the two eigenvalues is always exponentially
 small (it is suppressed at least by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-3N}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings in the deterministic slow-roll regime before reheating).
 Therefore, we may interpret the discrepancy as a limitation inherent in
 the stochastic approach to inflation.
 In other words, one cannot use the stochastic approach to establish the
 presence of eternal inflation more precisely than with the accuracy 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-3N}$
\end_inset

.
 Barring an extremely fine-tuned borderline case, this accuracy is perfectly
 adequate for establishing the presence or absence of eternal inflation.

We prove this by contradiction.
 If we had

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\ln\ln(1-X)$
\end_inset

 would diverge at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and then (assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{,\phi}\neq0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}}\partial_{\phi}\left[\ln\ln(1-X)\right]=-\lim_{\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}}\frac{\partial_{\phi}X}{(1-X)\ln(1-X)}=\infty.

\end_inset

It follows that the term 
\begin_inset Formula $K(X)$

 (If

 is approximately a solution of the linear equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{1}X=0$

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$

 A general solution has the form
\begin_inset Formula

 is never zero.
 However, solutions of linear equations cannot diverge at finite values

 Hence, the function

 cannot diverge at a finite value of

 This property can be equivalently expressed by saying that there exists

Note that

 By assumption, the largest eigenvalue of

 has all positive eigenvalues and 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\prime}(x)\leq3$

 Therefore, the constituents of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

 has all positive eigenvalues, while the function

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $h(0)=0$

\begin_inset Formula $h(X)\geq0$

\begin_inset Formula $0<h^{\prime}(X)<3+A$
\end_inset

 for all relevant 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $h(X)$

 monotonically grows, and also

 decreases monotonically for all relevant

\begin_inset Formula

Under these numerous conditions, we can demonstrate the existence and uniqueness

 We will now demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of positive solutions
 to this equation.

The idea of the construction is to find an initial function

 To compare functions, let us write for brevity 
\begin_inset Formula $f\geq g$

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi)\geq g(\phi)$

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in(\phi_{*}^{(1)},\phi_{*}^{(2)})$
\end_inset

 We will also show that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}(\phi)$

, which is a solution of Eq.

 Then we will prove that this solution is unique.

\begin_layout Standard
First, we note that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

monotonically increasing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}[f]\geq\hat{T}[g]$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $f\geq g$
\end_inset

.
 This property can be verified by considering 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{T}[f]-\hat{T}[g]=[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}(h(f)-h(g)).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)$
\end_inset

 monotonically grows (by construction) for all 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $h(f)-h(g)>0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $f>g$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi')$
\end_inset

 of the positive operator 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{L}+A$
\end_inset

 is positive, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi')>0$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}f(\phi)=\int d\phi^{\prime}G_{L}(\phi,\phi^{\prime})f(\phi')>0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

if 
\begin_inset Formula $f>0$
\end_inset

.
 To demonstrate that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}>0$
\end_inset

, we first show that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 cannot be equal to zero except at the boundaries.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi')=0$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'=\phi_{1}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 within the open interval 
\begin_inset Formula $(\phi_{*}^{(1)},\phi_{*}^{(2)})$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi'=\phi_{1}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a solution of the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
[-\hat{L}+A]\,G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})=\delta(\phi-\phi')\label{eq:Gl def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi_{*}^{(1,2)},\phi_{1}^{\prime})=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi_{1},\phi_{1}^{\prime})=0$
\end_inset

.
 One of the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}\equiv(\phi_{*}^{(1)},\phi_{1})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}\equiv(\phi_{1},\phi_{*}^{(2)})$
\end_inset

 does not contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us, without loss of generality, assume that it is 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

 that does not contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})$
\end_inset

 satisfies a homogeneous equation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
[-\hat{L}+A]\,G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})=0,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with zero boundary conditions at the boundaries of the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Any such solution would be an eigenfunction of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{L}+A$
\end_inset

 with zero boundary conditions at the boundaries of 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{L}+A$
\end_inset

 has all positive eigenvalues with zero boundary conditions on the interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $(\phi_{*}^{(1)},\phi_{*}^{(2)})$
\end_inset

 while its eigenvalues with zero boundary conditions on a smaller interval
 are strictly larger.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{L}+A$
\end_inset

 has no zero eigenfunctions, so 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in I_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi_{1}^{\prime})$
\end_inset

 is a solution of second-order differential equation and so cannot be identicall
y equal to zero throughout an 
\emph on
interval
\emph default
 of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 has the same sign and is nonzero everywhere.
 It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 is everywhere positive rather than everywhere negative.
 The positivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 follows if we consider the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{L}+A$
\end_inset

 with the smallest eigenvalue, which is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma+A$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
[-\hat{L}+A]\,f_{0}(\phi)=\left(\gamma+A\right)f_{0}(\phi).\label{eq:eigenfunction f0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Such an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 can be chosen everywhere positive and is nondegenerate.
 Now we need to choose a different scalar product in the space of functions,
 in such a way that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is self-adjoint

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is defined by Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:scalar product M def"

\end_inset

).
 Taking this scalar product of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi')$
\end_inset

 and using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Gl def"

\end_inset

), we find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle \left(\gamma+A\right)f_{0},G_{L}\right\rangle  & =\langle(-\hat{L}+A)\,f_{0},G_{L}\rangle\nonumber \\
 & =\langle f_{0},(-\hat{L}+A){\,G}_{L}\rangle\nonumber \\
 & =\int_{\phi_{*}^{(1)}}^{\phi_{*}^{(2)}}\negmedspace f_{0}(\phi)\delta(\phi-\phi')d\phi=f_{0}(\phi')>0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Since the integral of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}$
\end_inset

 with a positive function 
\begin_inset Formula $(\gamma+A)f_{0}$
\end_inset

 is positive, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{L}(\phi,\phi')>0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we need to find an initial function 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}[X_{0}]\geq X_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This function can be chosen as 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta f_{0}(\phi)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>0$
\end_inset

 is a sufficiently small constant and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is the positive eigenfunction satisfying Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eigenfunction f0"

\end_inset

).
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h(\beta f_{0})=K(\beta f_{0})+A\beta f_{0}=\left[K^{\prime}(0)+A\right]\beta f_{0}+O(\beta^{2}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We may choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 sufficiently small so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta f_{0}<1$
\end_inset

 and that the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\beta^{2})$
\end_inset

 in the above equation are negligible; then we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{T}[\beta f_{0}]=[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}h(\beta f_{0})\approx\frac{K^{\prime}(0)+A}{\gamma+A}\beta f_{0}>\beta f_{0},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we used the relationships 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
K^{\prime}(0)=3=\sup_{x\in(0,1)}\frac{K(x)}{x}\equiv\gamma_{*}>\gamma.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that the coincidence of the values 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\prime}(0)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{*}$
\end_inset

 is related to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x)/x$
\end_inset

 is monotonically decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having found 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}\equiv\beta f_{0}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}[X_{0}]>X_{0}$
\end_inset

 and using the increasing property of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

, we find that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n+1}\equiv\hat{T}[X_{n}]$
\end_inset

 is increasing, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n+1}>X_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We need to prove that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above.
 Consider the constant function 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\phi)=1$
\end_inset

; it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $[-\hat{L}+A]c=Ac$
\end_inset

 for any constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}c=A^{-1}c$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{T}[1]=[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}h(1)=1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 is an increasing operator, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{0}<1$
\end_inset

, it follows by induction that all 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}<1$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

 has a limit, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}(\phi)$
\end_inset

, since that sequence is increasing and bounded from above.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is a solution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}=\hat{T}[X_{\infty}]$
\end_inset

 and hence is a positive solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uniqueness of this positive solution can be demonstrated as follows.
 First we note that the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
minimal
\emph default
 positive solution; for suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is any solution, then 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is positive since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f=[-\hat{L}+A]^{-1}h(f)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

while 
\begin_inset Formula $h(f)>0$
\end_inset

 and the Green's function is also positive.
 Then we can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $f>\beta f_{0}$
\end_inset

 for sufficiently small 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 A positive solution 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi)$
\end_inset

 cannot have zero derivatives and at the same time zero values at the boundaries.
 Hence, the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 are nonzero at the boundaries.
 Then there exists a sufficiently small 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f>\beta f_{0}\equiv X_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from 
\begin_inset Formula $f>X_{0}$
\end_inset

 and from the increasing property of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}[f]>\hat{T}[X_{0}]\equiv X_{1}$
\end_inset

, and so by induction 
\begin_inset Formula $f>X_{n}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $f\geq X_{\infty}$
\end_inset

; in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is the minimal positive solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that there are no other positive solutions larger than
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}(\phi)$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

 are two different positive solutions such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}>f_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is self-adjoint with respect to the scalar product
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:scalar product for adjoint"

\end_inset

), we can perform the following computation,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
0 & =\langle\hat{L}f_{1},f_{2}\rangle-\langle f_{1},\hat{L}f_{2}\rangle=-\left\langle {K(f}_{1}),f_{2}\right\rangle +\left\langle f_{1},K(f_{2})\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\int_{\phi_{*}^{(1)}}^{\phi_{*}^{(2)}}\frac{d\phi}{M(\phi)}f_{1}f_{2}\left(\frac{K(f_{2})}{f_{2}}-\frac{K(f_{1})}{f_{1}}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

This is a contradiction since 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}>f_{1}$
\end_inset

 while the function 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x)/x$
\end_inset

 is strictly monotonically decreasing for all relevant 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

, so the last integrand is everywhere positive.
 Therefore, we cannot have another solution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f>X_{\infty}$
\end_inset

, so the positive solution 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 is unique.

\begin_layout Standard
The conclusion is that Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $X=1$

 (Theory suggests that it is far more probable that terminal vacua exist
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.) If terminal vacua exist then a typical comoving worldline will eventually
 enter a bubble of terminal type, at which point no further transitions
 to any other type of bubble will be possible.
 For landscapes with terminal bubbles, the late-time asymptotic solution
 can be written as

 If there are no terminal vacua, then the matrix

 If the probability distribution for the first element in the sequence is

 Therefore, the mean frequency of visiting a vacuum

In inflationary cosmology, observers appear only near the reheating surface
 in spacetime.
 If eternal inflation is present, the reheating surface contains infinitely
 many causally disconnected and (possibly) statistically inequivalent domains.
 Thus, in the context of eternal inflation there is no naturally defined
 mathematical measure on the set of all observers since it is a countably
 infinite set.
 Hence, one needs an

 comoving worldline

 If the ensemble contains infinitely many observers (this is typically the
 case for volume-based ensembles and sometimes also the case for worldline-based
 ensembles), a regularization procedure is needed to obtain probability
 distributions.
 Finding and applying suitable regularization procedures is a separate technical
 issue explored in Secs.

 This prescription in most cases does not require a cutoff since the number
 of observers along a single comoving worldline is almost surely finite.
 Therefore, we will refer to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 worldline-based measure rather than distinguish between different versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A principal difference between the worldline-based and volume-based measures
 is in their dependence on the initial state.
 When considering the volume-based measure, one starts from a finite initial
 spacelike 3-volume and restricts attention to the comoving future of that
 initial region.
 (Final results are insensitive to the choice of this 3-surface in spacetime
 or to its geometry.) The initial state consists of the initial values of
 the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 within the initial volume, and possibly a label 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the type of the initial bubble.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Naturally, it is assumed that the initial state is in the self-reproduction
 regime: For random-walk type models, the initial 3-volume is undergoing
 inflation rather than reheating and, for tunneling models, the initial
 3-volume is not situated within a terminal bubble.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 When considering the worldline-based measure, one also assumes knowledge
 of these data at the initial point of a worldline.
 It turns out that the worldline-based measure always yields results that
 depend sharply on the initial state (except for the case of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nonterminal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 landscape, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

a landscape scenario without terminal vacua).
 A theory of initial conditions is necessary to obtain a specific prediction
 from the worldline-based measure.
 In contrast, probabilities obtained using any of the volume-based measures
 are always independent of the initial conditions.
 This agrees with the concept of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stationarity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a self-reproducing universe as discussed in the earlier works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Linde:1993nz,Linde:1993xx,Garcia-Bellido:1994ci,Vilenkin:1995yd"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 where it was proposed that the universe as a whole forgets the initial
 state and continues forever producing reheated regions and inflating in
 a self-similar way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this time, there is no consensus as to which of the two classes of measures
 is the physically relevant one.
 I regard the two measures as reasonable answers to 
\emph on
different
\emph default
 questions.
 The first question is to determine the probability distribution for observed
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

, given that the observer is randomly chosen from all the observers present
 in the entire spacetime.
 Since we have no knowledge as to our position in the spacetime, the total
 duration of inflation in our past, or the total number of bubble nucleations
 preceding the most recent one, it appears reasonable to include in the
 ensemble all the observers that will ever appear anywhere in the spacetime.
 An answer to the first question is thus provided by a volume-based measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second question is posed in a rather different manner.
 In the context of tunneling-type eternal inflation, upon discovering the
 type of our bubble we may wish to leave a message to a future civilization
 that may arise in our place after an unspecified number of consecutive
 bubble nucleations.
 The analogous situation in the context of random-walk type inflation is
 a hypothetical observer located within an inflating region of spacetime
 who wishes to communicate with future civilizations that will eventually
 appear when inflation is finished in that region.
 The only available means of communication is by leaving a message in a
 sealed box.
 The message might contain the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\chi_{a})$
\end_inset

 for parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 that we expect the future civilization to observe.
 In this case, the initial state is 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 at the time of writing the message.
 It is clear that the message can be discovered only by future observers
 near the worldline of the box.
 It is then natural to consider the ensemble of observers appearing along
 that worldline; this ensemble certainly depends on the initial state, 
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

on the nucleation rates of various bubbles in the initial bubble.
 In that case, the correct message to be left in the box is 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\chi_{a})$
\end_inset

 computed according to the worldline-based measure with the known initial
 state.
 It is natural in that case that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\chi_{a})$
\end_inset

 depends on the initial state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calculations using the worldline-based measure usually do not require regulariza
tion (except for the case of nonterminal landscapes) because the worldline-based
 ensemble of observers is almost surely finite
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bousso:2006ev"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, in random-walk type models the worldline-based measure predicts
 the exit probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{exit}}$
\end_inset

, which can be computed by solving a suitable differential equation [see
 Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:for p exit"

 In contrast, the ensemble used in the volume-based measure is infinite
 and always requires a regularization.
 For this reason, in the following exposition we will concentrate on volume-base
d measure proposals.

 with

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi<\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be completely deterministic (fluctuation-free).
 It is also assumed that the diffusion-dominated range 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}<\phi<\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently wide to support eternal self-reproduction of inflating
 regions.
 There are two thermalization points, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

, which may be associated to different types of true vacuum and thus to
 different observed values of cosmological parameters.
 If we are interested in a volume-based measure, the question is to compare
 the volumes 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal V}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal V}_{2}$
\end_inset

 of regions thermalized into these two vacua.
 Since there is an infinite volume thermalized into either vacuum, one looks
 for the volume ratio

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}<\phi<\phi_{*}^{(2)}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{2}$

 will be expanded by fixed numbers of

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{j}=-4\pi\int_{\phi_{j}}^{\phi_{*}^{(j)}}\frac{H(\phi)}{H'(\phi)}d\phi.

 Therefore the volume of regions thermalized at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}^{(j)}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2$
\end_inset

, will be increased by the factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(3N_{j})$

 Hence, the volume ratio is

\begin{equation}
\frac{{\cal V}_{1}}{{\cal V}_{2}}=\exp\left(3N_{1}-3N_{2}\right).\label{eq:ans2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This answer is found in several volume-based measures, except the scale-factor
 cutoff where one finds 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}/V_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 and the RV cutoff where the answer is more complicated (see Sec.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is important to remark that in every volume-based proposal, the answer
 is independent of the initial state at the beginning of inflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The worldline-based measure gives a very different probability distribution
 in this toy model.
 One considers a single, randomly chosen comoving worldline and computes
 the probability of finishing at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(1)}$

 or at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 if the initial value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that the result depends sensitively on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 is exactly in the middle of the self-reproduction interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset space ~

if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, the probability of first reaching 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 during random walk are exactly equal, hence the probabilities of reaching
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 are equal.
 If the initial point is moved away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, say towards 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, the probability of first reaching 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 will be exponentially larger than that of first reaching 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We find that the worldline measure gives a prediction that depends sharply
 on the initial value of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

; a value that is beyond observation and may be predicted only by a fundamental
 theory of initial conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the prediction of the worldline measure in a model of random-walk
 eternal inflation is identical with the comoving exit probability (see
 Sec.

).
 In other words, it is the probability of a randomly chosen comoving point
 exiting through a given point of the reheating boundary in field space.
 This exit probability, of course, depends sensitively on the initial values
 of the fields at the beginning of inflation, which are unknown.

 The important assumption is that all parts of the reheating surface are

 of the 3-volume along the reheating surface since observers appear only
 along that surface.
 Once a measure is constructed, the volume-weighted distribution

In the presence of eternal inflation, the proper 3-volume of the reheating
 surface diverges even when we limit the spacetime domain under consideration
 to the comoving future of a finite initial spacelike 3-volume.
 In other words, a finite initial spacelike slice gives rise to an infinite
 reheating surface.
 Therefore, the reheating surface needs to be regularized.
\end_layout

In this section we consider the case when the reheating condition is met
 at a topologically compact and connected locus in the configuration space
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \phi,\chi_{a}\right\} $

 In this case, every connected component of the reheating surface in spacetime
 will contain all the possible values of the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$

 Hence, it suffices to consider a single connected piece of the reheating
 surface.

 The center of the field space is a diffusion-dominated regime.
 The reheating condition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

, selects a compact and connected region (a circle) in field space, which
 is the exit boundary for the random walk.
 The problem is to determine the volume-weighted probability distribution
 for the values of

\end_inset

 (see Sec.
\begin_inset space ~

).
 This is easy to see by considering a fiducial two-field model (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 drives inflation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 is an fluctuating parameter) and by computing the total 3-volume reheated
 until time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{\max}$
\end_inset

 with a given value 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
V(\chi;t_{\max}) & =\left|v_{\phi}(\phi_{*},\chi)\right|\int_{0}^{t_{\max}}P_{V}(\phi_{*},\chi,t)\,dt\nonumber \\
 & \approx\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi)\right|P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi_{*},\chi)\frac{e^{\tilde{\gamma}t_{\max}}}{\tilde{\gamma}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here we used the late-time behavior of the volume distribution,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{V}(\phi,\chi,\tau)\approx P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi,\chi)e^{\tilde{\gamma}\tau}.\label{eq:Pv0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows that the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 tends to a limit as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\max}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

; for instance we may compute the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{t_{\max}\rightarrow\infty}\frac{V(\chi_{1};t_{\max})}{V(\chi_{2};t_{\max})}=\frac{\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi_{1})\right|P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi_{*},\chi_{1})}{\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi_{2})\right|P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi_{*},\chi_{2})},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which predicts the relative probability of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{2}$
\end_inset

 at reheating in the equal-time cutoff.
 However, both the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 and the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{V}^{(\tilde{\gamma})}(\phi,\chi)$
\end_inset

 depend rather sensitively on the choice of the equal-time hypersurfaces.
 Since there appears to be no preferred choice of the cutoff hypersurfaces
 in spacetime, the equal-time cutoff cannot serve as an unbiased measure.
 For instance, the result

 The total volume of regions thermalized at

\begin_inset Formula

where we have omitted

 Thus we obtain the volume ratio as the limit 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

-dependent way.
 Namely, regions with a given value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 are cut off at a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

-dependent cutoff time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{c}(\varepsilon;\chi)$
\end_inset

, defined such that only a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 of the total comoving volume has not yet reheated in these regions.
 Finally, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is taken to zero, which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{c}(\varepsilon;\chi)\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, and the limit ratio of cutoff volumes is computed.
 Since the late-time asymptotic of the comoving volume distribution is of
 the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\phi,\chi,\tau)\approx P^{(\gamma)}(\phi,\chi)e^{-\gamma\tau},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

while the reheated comoving volume up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 is computed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi)\right|\int_{0}^{\tau}P(\phi_{*},\chi,\tau)d\tau,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

one finds that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

-dependent cutoff time is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{c}(\varepsilon;\chi)=\frac{1}{\gamma}\ln\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon\gamma}\frac{P^{(\gamma)}(\phi_{*},\chi)}{\int_{0}^{\infty}P(\phi_{*},\chi,\tau)d\tau}\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The physical volume reheated up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{c}(\varepsilon;\chi)$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
V(\varepsilon;\chi) & =\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi)\right|\int_{0}^{\tau_{c}(\varepsilon;\chi)}P_{V}(\phi_{*},\chi,\tau)d\tau\nonumber \\
 & \approx\left|v(\phi_{*},\chi)\right|P_{V}^{(\gamma)}(\phi_{*},\chi)\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon\gamma}\frac{P^{(\gamma)}(\phi_{*},\chi)}{\int_{0}^{\infty}P(\phi_{*},\chi,\tau)d\tau}\right]^{\tilde{\gamma}/\gamma}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

With 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, a volume ratio such as 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\varepsilon;\chi_{1})/V(\varepsilon;\chi_{2})$
\end_inset

 tends to a well-defined limit, which is the result of the

 Note that the results include the

 Namely, we define

 A finite region within the reheating surface is selected as a spherical
 region of radius

 (Since the reheating 3-surface is spacelike, the distance between points
 can be calculated as the length of the shortest path within the reheating
 3-surface.) Then the distribution of the quantities of interest is computed
 within the spherical region.
 Subsequently, the limit

 Since every portion of the reheating surface is statistically the same,
 the results are independent of the choice of the center point.
 The spherical cutoff is gauge-invariant since it is formulated entirely

Finally, we note that all the regularization methods reviewed so far were
 based on restricting the reheating surface by a geometric construction,
 such as by hypersurfaces of equal time.
 The worldline-based measure can be also viewed as a geometric restriction
 of the reheating surface (to a neighborhood of a comoving worldline).
 In the next chapters I will describe a measure proposal (the RV measure)
 that does not use any geometric constructions for regularizing the volume.

The regularization proposals reviewed in the previous section are not applicable
 to models with bubble nucleation because in those models the reheating
 surface consists of infinitely many 
\emph on
statistically
\emph default
 
\emph on
inequivalent
\emph default
 parts (the pieces of reheating surface in bubbles of different types).
 The same problem can be found in a simpler example: Consider an inflationary
 scenario with an 
\emph on

 slow-roll potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 having two minima

\end_inset

 such as in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 This scenario has two possibilities for thermalization, possibly differing
 in the observable parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 More generally, one may consider a scenario with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 different minima of the potential, possibly representing 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 distinct reheating scenarios.
 It is important that the minima 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(j)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,n$
\end_inset

 are topologically disconnected 
\emph on
in the field space
\emph default
.
 This precludes the possibility that different minima are reached within
 one connected component of the reheating hypersurface in spacetime.
 Additionally, the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 may fluctuate across each connected component in a way that depends on
 the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\chi_{a};j)$
\end_inset

 of the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 at each connected component of the reheating surface may depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the different components of the reheating surface may be
 
\emph on
statistically
\emph default
 
\emph on
inequivalent
\emph default
 with respect to the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a}$
\end_inset

 on them.
 To use the volume-based measure for making predictions in such models,
 one needs a regularization method that is applicable to situations with
 a large number of disconnected and statistically inequivalent components
 of the reheating hypersurface.

 a sphere of a finite radius

 will never reach parts of the reheating surface of different type

 Thus the spherical cutoff yields only the distribution of

 For clarity, we illustrate these weighting prescriptions on models of tunneling
 type where infinitely many nested bubbles of types 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1,...N$
\end_inset

 are created and where some bubbles are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

can contain no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

daughter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bubbles.
 In the volume-based approach, every bubble nucleated anywhere in the spacetime
 needs to be counted; in the worldline-based approach, only bubbles intersected
 by a selected worldline are counted.
 Let us now explain and examine these two prescriptions in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the set of all bubbles is infinite, one needs in any case to perform
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regularization,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is, one needs to select a very large but 
\emph on
finite
\emph default
 subset of bubbles.
 The weight 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 will be then calculated as the fraction of bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 within the selected subset; afterwards, the number of bubbles in the subset
 will be taken to infinity.
 Technically, the prescriptions differ in the choice of the finite subset
 of bubbles.
 The difference between the two prescriptions can be understood pictorially
 (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cap:bubbles2"

\end_inset

).
 In a spacetime diagram, one draws a finite number of timelike comoving
 geodesic worldlines emitted from an initial 3-surface towards the future.
 (It can be shown that the results are independent of the choice of these
 lines, as long as that choice is uncorrelated with the bubble nucleation
 process
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Easther:2005wi"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.) Each of these lines will intersect only a finite number of bubbles, since
 the final state of any worldline is (almost surely) a terminal bubble.
 The subset of bubbles needed for the regularization procedure is defined
 as the set of all bubbles intersected by at least one line.
 At this point, the volume-based approach assigns equal weight to each bubble
 in the subset, while the worldline-based approach assigns equal weight
 to each bubble along each worldline.
 As a result, the volume-based measure counts each bubble in the subset
 only once, while the worldline-based measure counts each bubble as many
 times as it is intersected by some worldlines.
 After determining the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 by counting the bubbles as described, one increases the number of worldlines
 to infinity and evaluates the limit values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\alpha}$

It is clear that the volume-based measure represents the counting of bubbles
 in the entire universe, and it is then appropriate that each bubble is
 being counted only once.
 On the other hand, the worldline-based measure counts bubbles occurring

 of the universe and introducing an unavoidable bias due to the initial
 conditions at the starting point of the worldline.

 Not only each pocket universe may contain infinitely many observers, but

 Pocket universes of different types are not statistically equivalent to
 each other because they have different rates of nucleation of other pocket
 universes.

 Nevertheless, one may try to formulate a prescription for calculating probabili

 Such a prescription, also called a

As I described in the previous chapters, eternal inflation gives rise to
 infinitely many causally disconnected regions of the spacetime where the
 cosmological observables may have significantly different values.
 One hopes to obtain probability distribution of the cosmological parameters
 as measured by an observer randomly located in the spacetime.
 The main difficulty in obtaining such probability distributions is due
 to the infinite volume of regions where an observer may be located.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the universe is cold and empty during inflationary evolution, observers
 may appear only after reheating.
 The standard cosmology after reheating is tightly constrained by current
 experimental knowledge.
 Hence, the average number of observers produced in any freshly-reheated
 spatial domain is a function of cosmological parameters in that domain.
 Calculating that function is, in principle, a well-defined astrophysical
 problem that does not involve any infinities.
 Therefore we focus on the problem of obtaining the probability distribution
 of cosmological observables at reheating.

To motivate the RV measure, we first visualize the measure problem as follows.
 It is convenient to consider an initial inflating spacelike region

 of the reheating surface that corresponds to the comoving future of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 If the 3-volume of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 were finite, the volume-weighted average of any observable quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 at reheating would be defined simply by averaging

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle Q\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\int_{R}Q\sqrt{\gamma}d^{3}x}{\int_{R}\sqrt{\gamma}d^{3}x},\label{eq:Q average}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle $

 One can then expect that the limit 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q_{R})\!\equiv\!\lim_{\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty}\!\frac{\left\langle {\!\left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|}_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle }{\mathcal{V}}\!=\!\lim_{\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty}\!\!\frac{\!\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\!\rho\left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}_{Q};\phi_{0},Q_{0}\right)\!\mathcal{V}_{Q}d\mathcal{V}_{Q}}{\mathcal{V}\,\mbox{Prob}(\text{Vol}(R)=\mathcal{V})}\label{eq:pQ RV}

\end_inset

exists and is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 (Below I will justify this statement more formally.) The function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q_{R})$
\end_inset

 is then interpreted as the mean fraction of the reheated volume where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, the RV cutoff yields the volume-weighted distribution for
 any cosmological observable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 at reheating.

To obtain a more visual picture of the RV cutoff, consider a large number
 of initially identical 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

-regions having different evolution histories to the future.
 A small subset of these initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 An even smaller subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions will have the total reheated volume equal to a given value 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 Conditioning on a finite value 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 of the reheating volume, one obtains a well-defined statistical ensemble
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 of initial

\end_inset

-regions.
 For large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 can be pictured as a set of initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 In this way, the ensemble

 samples the total reheating surface near the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It is precisely near these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spikes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that one would like to sample the distribution of observable quantities
 along the reheating surface.
 Therefore, one expects that the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 (in the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

 the small probability of the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Vol}(R)=\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 In this sense, the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 at large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

The RV cutoff proposed here has several attractive features.
 By construction, the RV cutoff is coordinate-invariant; indeed, only the
 intrinsically defined 3-volume within the reheating surface 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is used, rather than the 3-volume within a coordinate-dependent 3-surface.
 The results of the RV cutoff are also independent of initial conditions.
 This independence is demonstrated more formally below and can be understood
 heuristically as follows.
 The evolution of regions 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 conditioned on a large (but finite) value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Vol}(R)$
\end_inset

 is dominated by trajectories that spend a long time in the high-
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 inflationary regime and thereby gain a large volume.
 These trajectories forget about the conditions at their initial points
 and establish a certain equilibrium distribution of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 on the reheating surface.
 Hence, one can expect that the distribution of observables within the reheating
 domain 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 will be independent of the initial conditions in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

youngness paradox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arises in some volume-based prescriptions because 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions with delayed reheating are rewarded by an exponentially large additiona
l volume expansion.
 However, the RV measure groups together the 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions that produce 
\emph on
equal
\emph default
 final reheated volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; a delay in reheating is not rewarded but suppressed by the small probability
 of a quantum fluctuation at the end of inflation.
 Therefore, most of these 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 slow-roll evolution before reheating.
 For this reason, the youngness paradox is absent in the RV measure.
 A more explicit calculation confirming this conclusion will be given in

RV cutoff in slow-roll inflation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first specific application, I implement the RV measure in a slow-roll
 inflationary model with a scalar inflaton 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and the action
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S=\int\left[-\frac{R}{16\pi G}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}-V(\phi)\right]\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We recapitulate the main assumptions of the stochastic approach to inflation.
 If the energy density is dominated by the potential energy 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

, the Hubble expansion rate 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is approximately given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H\approx\sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{3}V(\phi)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the stochastic approach to inflation, the semiclassical dynamics of the
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 averaged over an 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region is a superposition of a deterministic motion with velocity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi}=v(\phi)\equiv-\frac{1}{4\pi G}H_{,\phi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and a random walk with root-mean-squared step size
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\left\langle \delta\phi\right\rangle ^{2}}=\frac{H(\phi)}{2\pi}\equiv\sqrt{\frac{2D(\phi)}{H(\phi)}},\quad D\equiv\frac{H^{3}}{8\pi^{2}},\label{eq:D def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

during time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t=H^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 A convenient description of the evolution of the field at time scales 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t\lesssim H^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(t+\delta t)=\phi(t)+v(\phi)\delta t+\xi(t)\sqrt{2D(\phi)\delta t},\label{eq:phi delta t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(t)$
\end_inset

 is (approximately) a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \xi\right\rangle =0,\quad\left\langle \xi(t)\xi(t')\right\rangle =\delta(t-t'),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is statistically independent for different 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions.
 This stochastic process describes the evolution 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 along a single comoving worldline.
 For convenience, we assume that inflation ends in a given 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 reaches a fixed value 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

The asymptotic behavior of the inverse Laplace transform of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 at large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is determined by the locations of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The dominant asymptotics of the inverse Laplace transform are of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\exp(z_{*}\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is the singularity with the smallest 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mbox{Re}\,z_{*}|$
\end_inset

 It can be shown that solutions of Eqs.

\emph on
finite

 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 cannot have 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

- or 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

-dependent singularities in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 cannot have pole-like singularities in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

; the only possible singularities are branch points where the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is finite but a derivative with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 diverges.
 Furthermore, derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}^{n}h$
\end_inset

 satisfy linear equations with coefficients depending on the derivatives
 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}^{n-1}g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

, which diverge at the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 Hence the singularities of

\end_inset

 in the

 For these reasons the limit in Eq.

The focus of this chapter is a more detailed study of the RV measure in
 the context of eternal inflation of random-walk type.
 As a typical generic model I choose a scenario where inflation is driven
 by the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\phi)$
\end_inset

 of a minimally coupled scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 In this model, there exists a range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 where large quantum fluctuations dominate over the deterministic slow-roll
 evolution, which gives rise to eternal self-reproduction of inflationary
 domains.
 I extensively use the stochastic approach to inflation, which is based
 on the Fokker–Planck or

\begin_layout Standard
An attractive feature of the RV measure is that its construction lacks extraneou
s geometric elements that could introduce a bias.
 An example of a biased measure is the equal-time cutoff where one considers
 the subdomain of the reheating surface to the past of a hypersurface of
 fixed proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{c}$
\end_inset

, subsequently letting 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known that the volume-weighted distribution of observables within
 a hypersurface of equal proper time is strongly dominated by regions where
 inflation ended very recently.
 A time delay 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 in the onset of reheating due to a rare quantum fluctuation is overwhelmingly
 rewarded by an additional volume expansion factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\exp[3H_{\max}\delta t]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\max}$
\end_inset

 is roughly the highest Hubble rate accessible to the inflaton.
 This is the essence of the youngness paradox that seems unavoidable in
 an equal-time cutoff.
 Moreover, the results of the equal-time cutoff are sensitive to the choice
 of the time gauge, as discussed in Sec.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 prescriptions were motivated by the need to remove the bias inherent in
 the equal-time cutoff.
 In particular, the spherical cutoff selects as a compact subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 the interior of a large sphere drawn within the reheating surface 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 around a randomly chosen center.
 The spherical cutoff is manifestly gauge-invariant since its construction
 uses only the intrinsically defined 3-volume of the reheating surface rather
 than the spacetime coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Some results were obtained in the spherical cutoff using numerical simulations
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vanchurin:1999iv"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A disadvantage of the spherical cutoff is that its direct implementation
 requires one to perform costly numerical simulations of random-walk inflation
 on a spacetime grid, for instance, using the techniques of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Linde:1993xx,Vanchurin:1999iv,Winitzki:1999ve"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Instead, one would prefer to obtain a generally valid analytic formula
 for the probability distribution of cosmological observables.
 For instance, one could ask whether the results of the spherical cutoff
 depend in an essential way on the spherical shape of the region, on the
 position of the center of the sphere, and on the initial conditions.
 Satisfactory answers to these questions (in the negative) were obtained
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vilenkin:1998kr,Vanchurin:1999iv"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 in some tractable cases where results could be obtained analytically.
 However, it is difficult to analyze these questions in full generality
 since one lacks a general analytic formula for the probability distribution
 in the spherical cutoff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RV measure is similar in spirit to the spherical cutoff because the
 RV cutoff uses only the intrinsic geometrical information defined by the
 reheating surface.
 It can be argued that the RV cutoff is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than other cutoffs in that it selects a finite portion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 of the reheating surface without using artificial constant-time hypersurfaces,
 spheres, worldlines, or any other extraneous geometrical data.
 Instead, the selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 in the RV cutoff is performed using a certain well-defined selection of
 subensemble in the probability space, which is determined by the stochastic
 evolution itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central concept in the RV cutoff is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finitely produced volume.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The basic idea is that there is always a nonzero probability that a given
 initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 give rise to an infinite reheating surface in its comoving future.
 For instance, it is possible that by a rare coincidence the inflaton field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 rolls towards reheating at approximately the same time everywhere in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, there is a nonzero (if small) probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})d\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 that the total volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Vol}(R)$
\end_inset

 of the reheating surface 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 belongs to a given interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}+d\mathcal{V}\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho(\mathcal{V})\equiv\lim_{d\mathcal{V}\rightarrow0}\frac{\mbox{Prob}\left\{ \mbox{Vol}(R)\in\left[\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}+d\mathcal{V}\right]\right\} }{d\mathcal{V}}.\label{eq:rho def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

I call 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finitely produced volume distribution.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This distribution is nontrivial because the probability of the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Vol}(R)<\infty$
\end_inset

 is nonzero, if small, for any given (non-reheated) initial region 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 is, by construction, normalized to that probability:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\rho(\mathcal{V})d\mathcal{V}=\mbox{Prob}\left\{ \mbox{Vol}(R)<\infty\right\} <1.\label{eq:rho V normalization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RV cutoff consists of a selection of a certain ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 of the histories that produce a total reheated volume equal to a given
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 starting from an initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 In the limit of large

\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions that evolve 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the regime of eternal inflation.
 Thus, heuristically one can expect that the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 provides a representative sample of the infinite reheating surface.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Of course, this heuristic statement cannot be made rigorous since there
 exists no natural measure on the infinite reheating surface.
 We use this statement merely as an additional motivation for considering
 the RV measure.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Given the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

, one can determine the volume-weighted probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q|{\cal E}_{\mathcal{V}})$
\end_inset

 of a cosmological parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 by ordinary sampling of the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 throughout the finite volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q)$
\end_inset

 is defined as the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q|{\cal E}_{\mathcal{V}})$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, provided that the limit exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify the construction of the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

, it is helpful to begin by considering the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 in a model that does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 permit eternal inflation.
 In that case, the volume of the reheating surface is finite with probability
 1, so the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 is an ordinary probability distribution normalized to unity.
 In that context, the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 was introduced in the recent work
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Creminelli:2008es"

\end_inset

 where the authors considered a family of inflationary models parametrized
 by a number 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, such that eternal inflation is impossible in models where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega>1$
\end_inset

.
 It was then found by a direct calculation that all the moments of the distribut
ion 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 diverge at the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=1$
\end_inset

 where the possibility of eternal inflation is first switched on.
 One can show that the 
\emph on
finitely produced
\emph default
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega<1$
\end_inset

 is again well-behaved and has finite moments (see Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Asymptotics-of-rho"

\end_inset

).
 This FPRV distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 is the formal foundation of the RV cutoff.
 It is worth emphasizing that the RV cutoff does not regulate the volume
 of the reheating surface by modifying the dynamics of a given inflationary
 model and making eternal inflation impossible.
 Rather, finite volumes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 are generated by rare chance (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~

 eternal inflation.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Specifically, I will compute the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the (homogeneous) value of the inflaton field in the initial region
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 To implement the RV cutoff explicitly for predicting the distribution of
 a cosmological parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, it is necessary to consider the joint finitely produced distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}};\phi_{0},Q_{0})$
\end_inset

 for the reheating volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}(R)$
\end_inset

 and the portion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}$
\end_inset

 of the reheating volume in which 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 (As before, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 are the values in the initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region.) If the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}};\phi_{0},Q_{0})$
\end_inset

 is found, one can determine the mean volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 while the total reheating volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is held fixed,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle =\frac{\int\rho(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}};\phi_{0},Q_{0})\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}d\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}}{\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0},Q_{0})}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then one computes the probability of finding the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 within the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[Q_{R},Q_{R}+dQ\right]$
\end_inset

 at a random point in the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q=Q_{R};\mathcal{V})\equiv\frac{\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle }{\mathcal{V}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The RV cutoff 
\emph on
defines
\emph default
 the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q)$
\end_inset

 for an observable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 as the limit of the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q;\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

 at large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q)\equiv\lim_{\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle }{\mathcal{V}}.\label{eq:p Q def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

One expects that this limit is independent of the initial values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0},Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 because the large volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is generated by regions that spent a very long time in the self-reproduction
 regime and forgot the initial conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous chapter I derived equations from which the distributions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}};\phi_{0},Q_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0},Q_{0})$
\end_inset

 can be in principle determined.
 However, a direct computation of the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 (for instance, by a numerical method) will be cumbersome since the relevant
 probabilities are exponentially small in that limit.
 One of the main results of the present chapter is an analytic evaluation
 of the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 and a derivation of a more explicit formula, Eq.

\end_inset

.
 The formula shows that the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q)$
\end_inset

 can be computed as a ground-state eigenfunction of a certain modified Fokker–Pl
anck equation.
 The explicit representation also proves that the limit

\begin_layout Standard
It was argued qualitatively in the previous chapter that the RV measure
 does not suffer from the youngness paradox.
 In this chapter I demonstrate the absence of the youngness paradox in the
 RV measure by an explicit calculation.
 To this end, I will consider a toy model where every 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region starts in the fluctuation-dominated (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-reproduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) regime with a constant expansion rate 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 and proceeds to reheating via two possible channels.
 The first channel consists of a short period 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t_{1}$
\end_inset

 of deterministic slow-roll inflation, yielding 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings until reheating; the second channel has a different period 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t_{2}\neq\delta t_{1}$
\end_inset

 of deterministic inflation, yielding 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings.
 (For simplicity, in this model one neglects fluctuations that may return
 the field from the slow-roll regime to the self-reproduction regime, and
 thus the time periods 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t_{2}$
\end_inset

 are sharply defined.) Thus there are two types of reheated regions corresponding
 to the two possible slow-roll channels.
 The task is to compute the relative volume-weighted probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(2)/P(1)$
\end_inset

 of regions of these types within the reheating surface.

\begin_layout Subsection
Preliminaries

\begin_layout Standard
I consider a model of slow-roll inflation driven by an inflaton 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 with the action 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int\left[\frac{R}{16\pi G}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}-V(\phi)\right]\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As before, I use the semiclassical stochastic approach to inflation in which
 the semiclassical dynamics of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 averaged over an 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region is regarded as a superposition of a deterministic slow roll, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi}=v(\phi)\equiv-\frac{V_{,\phi}(\phi)}{3H(\phi)}=-\frac{H_{,\phi}}{4\pi G},\label{eq:v def 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and a random walk with root-mean-squared step size
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\left\langle \delta\phi\right\rangle ^{2}}=\frac{H(\phi)}{2\pi}\equiv\sqrt{\frac{2D(\phi)}{H(\phi)}},\quad D\equiv\frac{H^{3}}{8\pi^{2}},\label{eq:D def 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

during time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t=H^{-1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is the function defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H(\phi)\equiv\sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{3}V(\phi)}.\label{eq:H def 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A useful effective description of the evolution of the field at time scales
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t\lesssim H^{-1}$
\end_inset

 can be given as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(t+\delta t)=\phi(t)+v(\phi)\delta t+\xi(t)\sqrt{2D(\phi)\delta t},\label{eq:phi delta t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(t)$
\end_inset

 is a normalized 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \xi\right\rangle =0,\quad\left\langle \xi(t)\xi(t')\right\rangle =\delta(t-t'),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is approximately statistically independent between different 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions.
 This stochastic process describes the evolution 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 and the accompanying cosmological expansion of space along a single comoving
 worldline.
 For simplicity, we assume that inflation ends in a given horizon-size region
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 is a fixed value such that the relative change of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 during one Hubble time 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t=H^{-1}$
\end_inset

 becomes of order 1, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\frac{H_{,\phi}vH^{-1}}{H}\right|_{\phi=\phi_{*}}=\left|\frac{H_{,\phi}^{2}}{4\pi GH^{2}}\right|_{\phi=\phi_{*}}\sim1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the point of view of the stochastic approach, an inflationary model
 is fully specified by the kinetic coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\phi)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\phi)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $H(\phi)$
\end_inset

Dynamics of any fluctuating cosmological parameter

 The evolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q(t+\delta t)=Q(t)+v_{Q}(\phi,Q)\delta t+\xi_{Q}(t)\sqrt{2D_{Q}(\phi,Q)\delta t},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the kinetic coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{Q}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $v_{Q}$
\end_inset

 can be computed, similarly to 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 are homogeneous and have values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 For convenience we assume that reheating starts when 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{\text{Pl}}$

 independently of the value of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although eternal inflation to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is almost always the case, it is possible that reheating is reached at
 a finite time everywhere to the future of

 In that event, the total reheating volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

\begin_inset Formula $S$

 The (small) probability of that event, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{Prob}\left(\mathcal{V}<\infty|\phi_{0},Q_{0}\right)\equiv\bar{X}(\phi_{0},Q_{0}),

 The distribution

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}(\phi_{0})$

The distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0})$

In the case of several fields, say

\begin_inset Formula $Q$

\begin_inset Formula

 to derive the asymptotic behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)$

 at large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

 This asymptotic behavior is determined by the right-most singularity of

 It turns out that the function

 always has a singularity at a real, nonpositive 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

, and that the singularity is of the type
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi)=g(z_{*};\phi)+\sigma(\phi)\sqrt{z-z_{*}}+O(z-z_{*}),\label{eq:g sing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\phi)$
\end_inset

 are determined as follows.
 One considers the (
\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\tilde{L}}\equiv\hat{L}+3(\ln g(z;\phi)+1),

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is the Fokker–Planck operator described above.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

 this operator is invertible in the space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi)$
\end_inset

 satisfying zero boundary conditions.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 turns out to be the algebraically largest real number (in any case, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}\leq0$
\end_inset

) such that there exists an eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\phi)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tilde{L}}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 surfaces does not expand with time (reheating of some regions is perfectly
 compensated by inflationary expansion of other regions).
 In that case, the only solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z=0;\phi)=\bar{X}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}\equiv1$
\end_inset

 because there are no eternally inflating comoving geodesics.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln g(z=0,\phi)=0$
\end_inset

, and so the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tilde{L}}$
\end_inset

 is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tilde{L}}=\hat{L}+3$

 It follows that the operator

 also has a zero eigenvalue at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}=0$

 This eigenfunction

 Then the RV-regulated distribution of

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q_{R})=\mbox{const}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}(z_{*};\phi,Q)}{\partial\phi}\frac{D_{\phi\phi}e^{-z_{*}H^{-3}}}{H^{4}}\right]_{\phi=\phi_{*},Q=Q_{R}},\label{eq:pQR main ans}

 For the purposes of the present argument, we may assume that there is exactly

\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(1)}<\phi<\phi_{1}$

\end_inset

, while the range 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}<\phi<\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently wide to allow for eternal self-reproduction.
 Thus there are two slow-roll channels that produce respectively

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $e$

-foldings of slow-roll inflation after exiting the self-reproduction regime.
 Since the self-reproduction range generates arbitrarily large volumes of
 space that enter both the slow-roll channels, the total reheating volume
 going through each channel is infinite.
 We apply the RV cutoff to the problem of computing the regularized ratio
 of the reheating volumes in regions of types 1 and 2.

We begin by considering the case when inflation is driven by a single scalar
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, such that reheating is reached at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

 be the probability density of obtaining the finite reheated volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

.
 We will derive an equation for a generating function of the distribution
 of volume, rather than an equation directly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 Since the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is by definition nonnegative, it is convenient to define a generating function
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

 through the expectation value of the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(-z\mathcal{V})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z>0$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi_{0})\equiv\left\langle e^{-z\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle _{\mathcal{V}<\infty}\equiv\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z\mathcal{V}}\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi_{0})d\mathcal{V}.\label{eq:g def}

 However, we use the subscript

 The finitely produced volume distribution for the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{k})$

 The combined reheating volume of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 daughter regions must be distributed with the same generating function
 as reheating volume of the original 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 Hence, by the multiplicative property we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi)=\prod_{k=1}^{N}g(z;\phi_{k}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 We can average both sides of this equation over the noise variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi)=\left\langle \prod_{k=1}^{N}g(z;\phi_{k})\right\rangle _{\xi_{1},...,\xi_{N}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{k}$
\end_inset

 are independent, the average splits into a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 identical factors, 
\begin_inset Formula

g(z;\phi)=\left[\left\langle g(z;\phi+v(\phi)\delta t+\sqrt{2D(\phi)}\xi)\right\rangle _{\xi}\right]^{N}.\label{eq:g equ pre}

0 & =\frac{\partial}{\partial\delta t}\ln g(z;\phi)\nonumber \\

The main nonlinear equation in the calculations of the RV cutoff is Eq.

 That equation differs from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 in the boundary conditions.
 Therefore, we may expect that solutions of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) may exist for some values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 but not for other values.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z=0;\phi)=\bar{X}(\phi)$
\end_inset

; hence, nontrivial solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 exist for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 under the same conditions as nontrivial solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X}(\phi)\not\equiv1$
\end_inset

 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 While it is certain that solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 exist for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq0$
\end_inset

, there may be values 
\begin_inset Formula $z<0$
\end_inset

 for which no real-valued solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 exist at all.
 However, the calculations in the RV cutoff require only to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 for a certain value 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}<0$
\end_inset

, which is the algebraically largest value 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 has a singularity in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The structure of that singularity will be investigated in detail below,
 and it will be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 is finite while 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial g/\partial z\propto(z-z_{*})^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

 diverges at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 remains well-defined at least for all real 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[z_{*},+\infty\right]$
\end_inset

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 may be obtained 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset space ~

by a numerical solution of a well-conditioned problem with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}+\varepsilon$

By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is an integral of a probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)$
\end_inset

 times 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-z\mathcal{V}}$
\end_inset

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is analytic in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and has no singularities for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Re}\,z>0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)$
\end_inset

 can be recovered from the generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 through the inverse Laplace transform,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)=\frac{1}{2\pi\text{i}}\int_{-\text{i}\infty}^{\text{i}\infty}\negmedspace dz\,e^{z\mathcal{V}}g(z;\phi),\label{eq:rho integral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the integration contour in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane can be chosen along the imaginary axis because all the singularities
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 are to the left of that axis.
 The RV cutoff procedure depends on the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)$
\end_inset

 and related distributions at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The asymptotic behavior at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 is determined by the type and the location of the right-most singularity
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 in the half-plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Re}\,z<0$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is such a singularity, the asymptotic is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V};\phi)\propto\exp[-z_{*}\mathcal{V}]$
\end_inset

.
 The prefactor in this expression needs to be determined; for this, a detailed
 analysis of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 will be carried out.

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to verify that the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

-independent.
 We first show that solutions of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g equ gen 1"

\end_inset

) cannot diverge at finite values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 If that were the case and say 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\ln g$
\end_inset

 as well as derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{,\phi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{,\phi\phi}$
\end_inset

 would diverge as well.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}}\partial_{\phi}\left[\ln\ln g\right]=\lim_{\phi\rightarrow\phi_{1}}\frac{\partial_{\phi}g}{g\ln g}=\infty.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows that the term 
\begin_inset Formula $g\ln g$
\end_inset

 is negligible near 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) compared with the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\phi}g$
\end_inset

 and hence also with the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\phi}\partial_{\phi}g$
\end_inset

.
 In a very small neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 can be approximated by a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{1}$
\end_inset

 with constant coefficients, such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{L}\approx\hat{L}_{1}\equiv A_{1}\partial_{\phi}\partial_{\phi}+B_{1}\partial_{\phi}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since at least one of the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},B_{1}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is approximately a solution of the linear equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{1}g=0$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, solutions of linear equations cannot diverge at finite values
 of the argument.
 Hence, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 cannot diverge at a finite value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only remaining possibility is that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 has singular points 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 remains finite while 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial g/\partial z$
\end_inset

, or a higher-order derivative, diverges at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We will now investigate such divergences and show that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 has a leading singularity of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi)=g(z_{*};\phi)+\sigma(\phi)\sqrt{z-z_{*}}+O(z-z_{*}),\label{eq:g sing structure}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

-independent location of the singularity such that 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}\leq0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\phi)$
\end_inset

 is yet to be determined.

\begin_inset Formula

\begin{equation}
g_{1}(\phi_{*})=-H^{-3}(\phi_{*})e^{-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*})},\quad g_{1}(\phi_{\text{Pl}})=0.\label{eq:g1 bc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 of this linear problem can be found using a standard method involving the
 Green's function.
 The problem with inhomogeneous boundary conditions is equivalent to the
 problem with zero boundary conditions but with an inhomogeneous equation.
 To be definite, let us consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 of the form used in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{L}=\frac{D(\phi)}{H(\phi)}\partial_{\phi}\partial_{\phi}+\frac{v(\phi)}{H(\phi)}\partial_{\phi}.\label{eq:L one dim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then Eqs.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{L}g_{1}+3\left(\ln g+1\right)g_{1} & =DH^{-4}e^{-zH^{-3}}\delta^{\prime}(\phi-\phi_{*}),\label{eq:g1 delta eq}\\
g_{1}(z;\phi_{*}) & =g_{1}(z;\phi_{\text{Pl}})=0.\label{eq:g1 delta bc}
\end{align}

\end_inset

 The solution of this inhomogeneous equation exists as long as the linear
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g+1)$
\end_inset

 does not have a zero eigenfunction with zero boundary conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g+1)$

 is explicitly 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)\neq0$

 by definition
\begin_inset space ~

 such that the integral in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\ln g$
\end_inset

 is finite for those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $G(z;\phi,\phi')$
\end_inset

 the Green's function of that operator with zero boundary conditions,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{L}G+3\left(\ln g(z,\phi)+1\right)G & =\delta(\phi-\phi'),\\
G(z;\phi_{*},\phi') & =G(z;\phi_{\text{Pl}},\phi')=0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

This Green's function is well-defined for values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g(z;\phi)+1)$
\end_inset

 is invertible.
 For these 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 we may express the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 of Eqs.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula

g_{1}(z;\phi)=-\left.\frac{D}{H^{4}}e^{-zH^{-3}}\right|_{\phi_{*}}\left.\frac{\partial G(z;\phi,\phi')}{\partial\phi'}\right|_{\phi'=\phi_{*}}.\label{eq:g1 through Green}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, for these 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)\equiv\partial g/\partial z$
\end_inset

 remains finite at every value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 A similar argument shows that all higher-order derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial^{n}g/\partial z^{n}$
\end_inset

 remain finite at every 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 for these 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 can occur only at certain 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

-independent points 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}^{\prime}$

 such a value with the algebraically largest real part; we already know

 Let us now show that the function

 In other words,

 We omit the formulation of precise conditions for self-adjointness of

 One expects that such a decomposition will still be possible because (heuristic

 Then we define 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$

 as the value with the (algebraically) largest real part, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 By construction, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Re}\,z>\mbox{Re}\,z_{*}$
\end_inset

 all the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

 are negative.
 Note that the (algebraically) largest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 is always nondegenerate, and the corresponding eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 can be chosen real and positive for all

This detailed investigation allows us now to determine the behavior of

 We will consider the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$

We have already shown that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 itself does not diverge at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 but its derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}\equiv\partial g/\partial z$
\end_inset

 does.
 Hence, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 is continuous, and the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)-g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is small for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

, so that we have the expansion 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\delta g(z;\phi) & \equiv g(z;\phi)-g(z_{*};\phi)\\
 & \approx g_{1}(z;\phi)\left(z-z_{*}\right)+O\left[(z_{*}-z)^{2}\right].\label{eq:delta g g1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

(Note that we are using the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 rather than the divergent value 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z_{*};\phi)$

 in the above equation.) On the other hand, we have the explicit representation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Let us examine the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

 can be found using standard perturbation theory for linear operators.
 If we denote the change in the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\hat{L}\equiv3(\ln g(z;\phi)-\ln g(z_{*};\phi))\approx\frac{3\delta g(z;\phi)}{g(z_{*};\phi)},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

we can write, to first order, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{0}(z)\approx\left\langle f_{0},\delta\hat{L}f_{0}\right\rangle =\int\left|f_{0}(\phi)\right|^{2}\frac{3\delta g(z;\phi)}{g(z_{*};\phi)}d\phi.\label{eq:lambda 0 integral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now, Eqs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta g(z;\phi)}{z-z_{*}}\approx-\frac{f_{0}(z;\phi)}{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\phi}\frac{D}{H^{4}}e^{-zH^{-3}}\right]_{\phi_{*}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Integrating the above equation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 with the prefactor
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|f_{0}(\phi)\right|^{2}\frac{3}{g(z_{*};\phi)}d\phi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

), we obtain a closed equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 in which terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z-z_{*}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

 have been omitted, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\lambda_{0}(z)}{z-z_{*}} & \approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\phi}\frac{D}{H^{4}}e^{-zH^{-3}}\right]_{\phi_{*}}\nonumber \\
 & \quad\times\int\left|f_{0}\right|^{2}\frac{3\delta g(z;\phi)}{g(z_{*};\phi)}f_{0}(\phi)d\phi.\label{eq:lambda 0 ans}
\end{align}

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)\propto\sqrt{z-z_{*}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)\propto\left(z-z_{*}\right)^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

, confirming the leading asymptotic of the form
\begin_inset space ~

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us also obtain a more explicit form of the singularity structure of
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 We can rewrite Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{0}(z)\approx\sigma_{0}\sqrt{z-z_{*}}+O(z-z_{*}),\label{eq:lambda 0 sing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a constant that may be obtained explicitly.
 Then Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g_{1}(z;\phi)\approx\frac{f_{0}(z;\phi)}{\sqrt{z-z_{*}}}\sigma_{1},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with a different constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we can integrate this in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;\phi)=g(z_{*};\phi)+2\sigma_{1}f_{0}(z;\phi)\sqrt{z-z_{*}}+O(z-z_{*}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We may rewrite this by substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
g(z;\phi) & =g(z_{*};\phi)+\sigma(\phi)\sqrt{z-z_{*}}+O(z-z_{*}),\label{eq:g asympt sigma 1}\\
\sigma(\phi) & \equiv2\sigma_{1}f_{0}(z_{*};\phi).
\end{align}

\end_inset

The result is now explicitly of the form
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It will turn out that the normalization constant 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 cancels in the final results.
 So in a practical calculation the eigenfunction 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 may be determined with an arbitrary normalization.

As a side note, let us remark that the argument given above will apply also

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g+1)$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate when it vanishes at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}^{\prime}$

 If the relevant eigenvalue becomes degenerate, the singularity structure
 will not be of the form

 & =\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\sigma(\phi)\mathcal{V}^{-3/2}e^{z_{*}\mathcal{V}}.\label{eq:rho asympt 1}

 This is so because the integral

 The generating function

The solution for the function

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

 In the context of the RV cutoff, one is interested in the event when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is finite and very large.
 Then one expects that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}_{Q}$
\end_inset

 also becomes typically very large while the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}_{Q}/\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 remains roughly constant.
 In other words, one expects that the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}_{Q}$
\end_inset

 is sharply peaked around a mean value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathcal{V}_{Q}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathcal{V}_{Q}\right\rangle /\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is well-defined at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 The value of that limit is the only information we need for calculations
 in the RV cutoff.
 Therefore, we do not need to compute the entire distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{V_{Q}};\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle $

 at fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$

Let us therefore define the generating function of the mean value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle $

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h(z;\phi,Q)\equiv\left\langle \mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}e^{-z\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle _{\mathcal{V}<\infty}=-\frac{\partial\tilde{g}}{\partial q}(z,q=0;\phi,Q).

(The dependence on the fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{R}$
\end_inset

 is kept implicit in the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 in order to make the notation less cumbersome.) The differential equation
 and the boundary conditions for 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 follow straightforwardly by taking the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{q}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 of Eqs.

 It is clear from the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(z,q=0;\phi,Q)=g(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 Hence we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{L}h+3\left(\ln g(z;\phi,Q)+1\right)h & =0,\label{eq:h equ pre 0}\\
h(z;\phi_{*},Q) & =\frac{e^{-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*},Q)}}{H^{3}(\phi_{*},Q)}\delta_{QQ_{R}},\\

\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This behavior is determined by the leading singularity of the function
 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane.

\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$

 and show that 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 cannot have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Q$

-dependent singularity in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 has precisely the same singular points, in particular 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

, as the basic generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 of the reheating volume.
 Indeed, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through the Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $G(z;\phi,Q,\phi',Q')$
\end_inset

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g+1)$
\end_inset

, similarly to the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 considered in Sec.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 For 
\begin_inset Formula $z\neq z_{*}$
\end_inset

, this operator is invertible on the space of functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 satisfying zero boundary conditions.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 is nonsingular at 
\begin_inset Formula $z\neq z_{*}$
\end_inset

 and becomes singular precisely at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now obtain an explicit form of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 near the singular point 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume again the eigenfunction decomposition of the Green's function
 (with the same caveats as in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Singularities-of-g"

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G(z;\phi,Q,\phi',Q')=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\lambda_{n}(z)}f_{n}(z;\phi,Q)f_{n}^{*}(z;\phi',Q'),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}$
\end_inset

 are appropriately normalized eigenfunctions of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-dependent operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}+3(\ln g+1)$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}$
\end_inset

 must satisfy zero boundary conditions at reheating and Planck boundaries.
 Similarly to the way we derived Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g1 explicit"

\end_inset

), we obtain the explicit solution
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h(z;\phi,Q)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f_{n}(z;\phi,Q)}{\lambda_{n}(z)}\left[\frac{\partial f_{n}}{\partial\phi}\frac{D_{\phi\phi}e^{-zH^{-3}}}{H^{4}}\right]_{\phi_{*},Q_{R}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is dominated by the contribution of the large factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\lambda_{0}(z)\propto\left(z-z_{*}\right)^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

, so the leading term is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h(z;\phi,Q)\approx\frac{f_{0}(z_{*};\phi,Q)}{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\phi}\frac{D_{\phi\phi}e^{-z_{*}H^{-3}}}{H^{4}}\right]_{\phi_{*},Q_{R}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The asymptotic behavior of the mean value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle _{\mathcal{V}<\infty}$
\end_inset

 is determined by the singularity of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 As before, we may deform the integration contour to pass near the real
 axis around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We can then express the large-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 asymptotic of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle _{\mathcal{V}<\infty}$
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{Q_{R}}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle  & =\frac{1}{2\pi\text{i}}\int_{-\text{i}\infty}^{\text{i}\infty}\!e^{z\mathcal{V}}h(z;\phi,Q)dz\nonumber \\
 & \approx\frac{f_{0}(z_{*};\phi,Q)}{\sqrt{\pi}\sigma_{0}\sqrt{\mathcal{V}}}e^{z_{*}\mathcal{V}}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\phi}\frac{D_{\phi\phi}e^{-z_{*}H^{-3}}}{H^{4}}\right]_{\phi_{*},Q_{R}},\label{eq:V QR ave ans}
\end{align}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the constant defined by Eq.

We now complete the analytic evaluation of the limit
\begin_inset space ~

 Since the denominator of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pQR limit 1"

\end_inset

) has the large-
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 asymptotics of the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{V}\int_{0}^{\infty}\negmedspace g(z;\phi,Q)e^{z\mathcal{V}}d\mathcal{V}\propto f_{0}(z_{*};\phi,Q)\mathcal{V}^{-\frac{1}{2}}e^{z_{*}\mathcal{V}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the same eigenfunction, the dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 identically cancels in the limit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pQR limit 1"

\end_inset

).
 Hence, that limit is independent of the initial values 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but is a function only of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{R}$
\end_inset

, on which 
\begin_inset Formula $h(z;\phi,Q)$
\end_inset

 implicitly depends.
 Using this fact,, we can significantly simplify the rest of the calculation.
 It is not necessary to compute the denominator of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pQR limit 1"

\end_inset

) explicitly.
 The distribution of the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{*}$
\end_inset

 is simply proportional to the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{R}$
\end_inset

-dependent part of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

); the denominator of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pQR limit 1"

\end_inset

) serves merely to normalize that distribution.
 Hence, the RV cutoff yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q_{R})=\mbox{const}\left[\frac{\partial f_{0}(z_{*};\phi,Q)}{\partial\phi}\frac{D_{\phi\phi}e^{-z_{*}H^{-3}}}{H^{4}}\right]_{\phi=\phi_{*},Q=Q_{R}},\label{eq:PQR ans 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the normalization constant needs to be chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int p(Q_{R})dQ_{R}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is the final analytic formula for the RV cutoff applied to the distributio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 at reheating.

\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$

Let us comment on the presence of the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\phi\phi}$

 The

diffusion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $D_{\phi\phi}$

 is evaluated at the reheating boundary and is thus small since the fluctuation
 amplitude at reheating is (in slow-roll inflationary models)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta\phi}{\phi}\sim\frac{H^{2}}{\dot{\phi}}=\frac{\sqrt{8\pi^{2}D_{\phi\phi}H}}{v_{\phi}}\sim10^{-5}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Nevertheless it is not possible to set 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\phi\phi}=0$
\end_inset

 directly in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 This is so because the existence of the Green's function of the Fokker–Planck
 operator such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 depends on the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is a second-order differential operator of elliptic type.
 If one sets 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\phi\phi}=0$
\end_inset

 near the reheating boundary, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 becomes first-order in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at that boundary.
 Then one needs to use a different formula than Eq.

 Since the equation is first-order within the deterministic regions, the

The singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 of the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is found by using the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial g/\partial z\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Differentiating Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{1,2})$
\end_inset

, we obtain the condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & -\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2E(z)-2U(g)}}+\frac{e^{3N_{1,2}}H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1,2)})}{\sqrt{2E(z)-2U(g(z;\phi_{1,2}))}}\nonumber \\
 & -E^{\prime}(z)\int_{g(z;\phi)}^{g(z;\phi_{1,2})}\frac{dg}{\left[2E(z)-2U(g)\right]^{3/2}}=0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial g/\partial z\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(z)=U(g(z;\phi_{1,2})).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This condition is interpreted in the language of Fig.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 as follows.
 As the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 becomes more negative, the initial and the final values of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 The last available trajectory starts from rest at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and at the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $U(g)=E$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain a specific result, let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}-\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large to provide self-reproduction (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}-\phi_{1}\gg H_{0}$
\end_inset

) and that the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings in channel 1 is smaller than that in channel 2, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})\exp\left(3N_{1}\right)\ll H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(2)})\exp\left(3N_{2}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then the value 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{2})$
\end_inset

 will grow faster than 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{1})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 becomes more negative.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi_{2})$
\end_inset

 will reach the singular point first.
 Since the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}-\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 is large, the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 will be close to 0 so that the trajectory spends a long 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $g=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the value 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi_{2})$
\end_inset

 will be close to 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is approximately
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z_{*}\approx-\frac{1}{2}H^{3}(\phi_{*}^{(2)})\exp\left(-3N_{2}\right).\label{eq:z star estimate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For this value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

, the starting point of the trajectory will be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z_{*};\phi_{1})\approx\exp\left[\frac{1}{2}\exp\left(3N_{1}-3N_{2}\right)\right]\approx1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 at the singular point 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 can be visualized as the thin line in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Potential-U"

\end_inset

, starting approximately at 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi_{1})=1$
\end_inset

 and finishing at 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi_{2})\approx e^{1/2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An approximate expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $E\approx0$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g sol implicit"

\end_inset

); then the integral can be evaluated analytically.
 In the range 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}<\phi<\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{2}-\phi\approx\negmedspace\int_{g(z_{*};\phi)}^{g(z_{*};\phi_{2})}\negmedspace\frac{dg}{\sqrt{-2U(g)}}\approx\frac{H_{0}}{\sqrt{12\pi^{2}}}\left.\sqrt{1-2\ln g}\right|_{\phi_{2}}^{\phi},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so the solution is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z_{*};\phi)\approx\exp\left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{6\pi^{2}}{H_{0}^{2}}\left(\phi_{2}-\phi\right)^{2}\right],\quad\phi_{0}<\phi<\phi_{2}.\label{eq:g approx 2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the range 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}<\phi<\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 we obtain within the same approximation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z_{*};\phi)\approx\exp\left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{6\pi^{2}}{H_{0}^{2}}\left(\phi-\phi_{1}+{\textstyle \frac{H_{0}}{\sqrt{12\pi^{2}}}}\right)^{2}\right].\label{eq:g approx 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

These approximations are valid for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 within the indicated ranges and away from the turning point 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 can be estimated by requiring that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

 obtained from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) be equal to that obtained from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g approx 1"

\end_inset

).
 This yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi_{0}\approx\frac{1}{2}\left[\phi_{2}+\phi_{1}-{\textstyle \frac{H_{0}}{\sqrt{12\pi^{2}}}}\right]\approx\frac{\phi_{2}+\phi_{1}}{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We note that the value 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi_{0})$
\end_inset

 can be obtained somewhat more precisely by approximating the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 in a narrow interval near 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 by a function of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left[A+B(\phi-\phi_{0})^{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 and matching both the values and the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 to the approximations
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, a uniform analytic approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained.
 However, the accuracy of the approximations
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having obtained adequate analytic approximations for 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*},\phi)$
\end_inset

, we can now proceed to the calculation of the mean volumes 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \left.\mathcal{V}_{1,2}\right|_{\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of regions reheated through channels 1 and 2 respectively, conditioned
 on the event that the total volume of all reheated regions is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

.
 We use the formalism developed in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:FPRV-distribution-of-Q"

\end_inset

, where the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 now takes only the discrete values 1 and 2, so instead let us denote that
 value by 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 The relevant generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{j}(z;\phi)\equiv\left\langle \mathcal{V}_{j}e^{-z\mathcal{V}}\right\rangle _{\mathcal{V}<\infty},\quad j=1,2,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and is found as the solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

), which now takes the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\frac{D(\phi)}{H(\phi)}\partial_{\phi}\partial_{\phi}+\frac{v(\phi)}{H(\phi)}\partial_{\phi}+3(\ln g(z;\phi)+1)\right]h_{j}(z;\phi)=0,\label{eq:h equ toy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with boundary conditions imposed at the reheating boundaries,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
h_{1}(z;\phi_{*}^{(1)}) & =H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})e^{-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})},\quad h_{1}(z;\phi_{*}^{(2)})=0;\label{eq:h1 bc for 12}\\
h_{2}(z;\phi_{*}^{(1)}) & =0,\quad h_{2}(z;\phi_{*}^{(2)})=H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(2)})e^{-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(2)})}.\label{eq:h2 bc for 12}
\end{align}

\end_inset

In the present toy model the diffusion coefficient is set to zero at reheating,
 so the formalism developed in Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:FPRV-distribution-of-Q"

\end_inset

 needs to be modified.
 We will first solve Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) analytically in the no-diffusion intervals of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and obtain the boundary conditions for 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 at the boundaries of the self-reproduction regime 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\phi)\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the methods of Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:FPRV-distribution-of-Q"

\end_inset

 will be applicable to the boundary value problem for the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing this idea in the first no-diffusion region 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{*}^{(1)}<\phi<\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

, we use the solution
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g sol nodiff 12"

\end_inset

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 and reduce Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\phi}h_{j}+\frac{3H}{v}\left[1-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})\exp\!\left(-3\!\int_{\phi_{*}^{(1)}}^{\phi}\!\!\frac{H}{v}d\phi\right)\!\right]h_{j}=0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation is easily integrated together with the boundary conditions
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:h1 bc for 12"

\end_inset

)–(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) and yields the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{j}(z;\phi_{1})=\delta_{j1}H^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})\exp\left[3N_{1}-zH^{-3}(\phi_{*}^{(1)})e^{3N_{1}}\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly we can determine the values 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}(z;\phi_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Since the value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is important for the present calculation, we now find the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 using the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}\gg N_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the estimate
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:z star estimate"

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{j}(z_{*};\phi_{i})\approx\delta_{ij}\frac{\exp\left[3N_{i}+\frac{1}{2}\delta_{i2}\right]}{H^{3}(\phi_{*}^{(i)})},\quad i,j=1,2.\label{eq:h bc new}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We have thus reduced the problem of determining 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}(z;\phi)$
\end_inset

 to the boundary-value problem for the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 where the methods of Sec.

The next step, according to Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(z_{*};\phi)$
\end_inset

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\tilde{L}}\equiv\frac{D_{0}}{H_{0}}\partial_{\phi}\partial_{\phi}+3(\ln g(z_{*};\phi)+1)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\tilde{L}}f_{0}=0;\quad f_{0}(z_{*};\phi_{1,2})=0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As we have shown, this eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0 exists precisely
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Once this eigenfunction is computed, the ratio of the RV-regulated mean
 volumes in channels 1 and 2 will be expressed through the derivatives of
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}$

 at the endpoints and through the modified boundary conditions
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{P(2)}{P(1)}=\frac{h_{2}(z_{*};\phi_{2})}{h_{1}(z_{*};\phi_{1})}\frac{\left|\partial_{\phi}f_{0}(z_{*};\phi_{2})\right|}{\partial_{\phi}f_{0}(z_{*};\phi_{1})}.\label{eq:P2P1 pre}

The absolute value is taken to compensate for the negative sign of the derivativ

 Since

Using the terminology of quantum mechanics, there is a potential barrier
 separating two classically allowed regions near

 Since the

potential well
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The shape of the eigenfunction is sketched in Fig.

 The exponential suppression of the amplitude near

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\left|\partial_{\phi}f_{0}(z_{*};\phi_{2})\right|}{\partial_{\phi}f_{0}(z_{*};\phi_{1})}=A_{21}\exp\left[\int_{\tilde{\phi}_{1}}^{\tilde{\phi}_{2}}\sqrt{\tilde{V}(\phi)}d\phi\right],

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are the turning points such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}(\tilde{\phi}_{1,2})=0$
\end_inset

.
 The pre-exponential factor 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{21}$
\end_inset

 is of order 1 and can, in principle, be obtained from a more detailed matching
 of the WKB-approximated solution across the barrier to the solutions in
 the

\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(z_{*};\phi)$

 numerically.
 However, we will omit this calculation since the main result will consist
 of an exponentially large factor.
 That factor can be estimated using Eqs.

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter I extend the RV measure, originally formulated in the context
 of random-walk inflation, to landscape scenarios.
 The basic idea of the RV proposal is to select multiverses that are very
 large but (by rare chance) have a finite total number of observers.
 In the context of a string landscape scenario (or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recycling universe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), this can happen if sufficiently many anti-de Sitter or Minkowski bubbles
 nucleate everywhere, collide, and merge.
 In such a case, there will be a finite time after which no de Sitter regions
 remain and no further nucleations can occur.
 Hence, there will be a finite time after which no more observers are created
 anywhere.
 By this construction, one obtains a subensemble of multiverses having a
 fixed, finite total number 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{obs}}$
\end_inset

 of observers.
 These finite multiverses with very large 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{obs}}$
\end_inset

 are regarded as controlled approximations to the actual infinite multiverse.
 The observer-weighted statistical distribution of any quantity within a
 finite multiverse can be obtained by ordinary counting, since the total
 number of observers within any such multiverse is finite.
 The limit of that statistical distribution as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{obs}}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 is the final result of the RV prescription.
\end_layout

It was shown in Chapters

 that the RV measure is gauge-invariant, independent of the initial conditions,
 and free of the youngness paradox in the context of random-walk inflation.
 Presently I investigate whether the same features persist in an application
 of the RV measure to landscape scenarios.
 In particular, it is important to obtain RV predictions with respect to
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 problem that has been widely discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, the RV prescription can be extended to landscape models in
 different ways, depending on the precise choice of the ensemble of finite
 multiverses.
 The ensemble of multiverses with a fixed total number of observers 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{obs}}$
\end_inset

 (where one counts both the ordinary observers and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boltzmann brains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) appears to be the natural choice.
 However, it is difficult to compute the number of observers directly and
 unambiguously.
 Instead of the total number of observers, I propose to fix the total number
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

 of bubbles nucleated to the future of an initial bubble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total number of ordinary observers in bubbles of a given kind is proportiona

, which neglects the effects of bubble wall geometry, is adequate for the
 purposes of volume counting.
 Then the evolution of the landscape is well described by the approximate

.
 In that approximation, one keeps track only of the number of new bubbles
 nucleated in previously existing bubbles, and each new bubble is assumed
 to be instantaneously nucleated exactly of Hubble size in comoving coordinates.
 Motivated by this approximation,  I study a simplified definition of the
 RV measure for a landscape scenario (see Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Extending-the-RV"

 for details): One requires the total number of bubbles of all types, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

, to be finite and evaluates the statistical distribution of bubble types
 (or other cosmological observables) in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 In principle, this limit can be calculated if the bubble nucleation rates
 are known.
 Since this  is a first attempt to perform this technically challenging
 calculation, I concentrate only on bubble abundances and on the relative
 abundance of Boltzmann brains.
 I neglect the increased number of observers due to additional slow-roll
 inflation within bubbles; this effect was considered in

 I apply the RV measure proposal to a toy model of the landscape with four
 vacua (the FABI model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Garriga:2005av"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 In this model, the vacua labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 are de Sitter (dS) and the vacua labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 are anti-de Sitter (AdS) states.
 One assumes that only the transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $F\rightarrow I$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I\rightarrow F$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 are allowed, with known nucleation rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{FI}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{IF}$
\end_inset

, etc., per unit Hubble 4-volume.
 I show in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ratios 2"

\end_inset

) that the RV-regulated bubble abundances depend on the value of the dimensionle
ss number
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta\equiv\left(\frac{\kappa_{IB}}{\kappa_{FA}}\right)^{\nu+1}\frac{\kappa_{FI}}{\kappa_{IF}},\quad\nu\equiv e^{3}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, introduced for convenience, is simply the number of statistically independent
 Hubble regions after one 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-folding.
 Barring fine-tuned cases, one expects that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is either much larger than 1 or much smaller than 1, since the nucleation
 rates may differ by exponentially many orders of magnitude.
 By relabeling the vacua (
\begin_inset Formula $F\leftrightarrow I$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leftrightarrow B$
\end_inset

) if necessary, we may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\ll e^{-6}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the bubble abundances are approximately described by the ratios
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(I):p(F):p(A):p(B)\approx\frac{1}{\nu^{2}}:\frac{1}{\nu}:1:\left[\frac{\eta}{\nu^{\nu-1}}\right]^{\frac{1}{\nu+1}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This result can be interpreted as follows.
 Each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 bubbles produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, and each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 bubbles produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The abundance of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 bubbles is negligible compared with other bubbles.
 Heuristically, the chain of transitions 
\begin_inset Formula $I\rightarrow F\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dominant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 chain in the landscape.
 The fine-tuned case, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-6}<\eta<e^{6}$
\end_inset

, is considered separately, and the result is given by Eq.

 (Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-Boltzmann-brain"

\end_inset

).
 The total number of BBs is proportional to the total number of Hubble regions
 (
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions, or 4-volumes of order 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{-4}$
\end_inset

 The coefficient of proportionality is the tiny nucleation rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma^{BB}$
\end_inset

 of Boltzmann brains, which is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(-10^{50})$
\end_inset

 or smaller.
 In comparison, ordinary observers occur at a rate of at least 1 per horizon
 volume.
 It turns out that (after applying the RV cutoff) the total number of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions of dS types 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is approximately equal to the total number of nucleated bubbles of the
 same type.
 Hence, the BBs are extremely rare compared with ordinary observers.

 I extend the same calculations to a general landscape with an arbitrary

 The RV prescription predicts a definite ratio

\begin_inset Formula $j$

\begin_inset Formula $k$

, it is possible to show in full generality that the RV measure gives well-defin
ed results that are independent of the initial conditions.
 Nevertheless, actually performing the required calculations for an arbitrary
 landscape remains a daunting task.
 To obtain explicit expressions in a semi-realistic setup, I calculate the
 bubble abundances for a landscape that contains a single high-energy vacuum
 and a large number of low-energy vacua.
 The result is an approximate formula [Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

 Further, the mean fraction of

 Again one expects that the limit exists and is independent of the initial
 bubble type, as long as the initial bubble is not of terminal type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a specific example requiring fewer calculations, let us consider a toy
 model with only three bubble types.
 There is one de Sitter (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda>0$
\end_inset

) vacuum labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $j=3$
\end_inset

 that can decay into two possible anti-de Sitter terminal bubbles labeled
 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=2$
\end_inset

 The growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

 and the nucleation probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{31}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{32}$
\end_inset

 are assumed known.
 To mimic interesting features of the landscape, let us also assume that
 there is a period of slow-roll inflation inside the bubbles 1 and 2, generating
 respectively 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 additional 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-foldings of inflationary expansion after nucleation.
 Hence, the model is determined by the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{31}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{32}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 For convenience we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{33}\equiv1-\kappa_{31}-\kappa_{32}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now perform the calculations for the RV cutoff in this simple model.
 There are only two generating functions, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}(z,q;k)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}(z,q;k)$
\end_inset

, that need to be considered.
 The only meaningful initial value is 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, the initial bubble is of de Sitter type) since the two other bubble types
 do not lead to eternal inflation.
 Hence, we will suppress the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}(z,q;k)$
\end_inset

.
 We also need to modify Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g equ landscape"

\end_inset

) to take into account the additional expansion inside the terminal bubbles.
 Let us denote the volume expansion factors by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{1}\equiv e^{3N_{1}},\quad Z_{2}\equiv e^{3N_{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are solutions of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
g_{1}^{1/n_{3}} & =\kappa_{31}z^{Z_{1}}q^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z^{Z_{2}}+\kappa_{33}g_{1},\\
g_{2}^{1/n_{3}} & =\kappa_{31}z^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z^{Z_{2}}q^{Z_{2}}+\kappa_{33}g_{2}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

An explicit solution of these equations is impossible for a general 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

 (barring the special cases 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}=2,3,4$
\end_inset

).
 Nevertheless, sufficient information about the limit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:p n'n lim 1"

\end_inset

) can be obtained by the following method.
 Introduce the auxiliary function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 as the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $F>0$
\end_inset

 of the algebraic equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F^{1/n_{3}}=x+\kappa_{33}F,\label{eq:F def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

choosing the branch connected to the value 
\begin_inset Formula $F(0)=0$
\end_inset

.
 (It is straightforward to see that Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:F def"

\end_inset

), has at most two positive solutions, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 is always the smaller solution of the two.) The generating functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are then expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
g_{1}(z,q) & =F(\kappa_{31}z^{Z_{1}}q^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z^{Z_{2}}),\label{eq:g1 through F}\\
g_{2}(z,q) & =F(\kappa_{31}z^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z^{Z_{2}}q^{Z_{2}}).\label{eq:g2 through F}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The limit
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:p n'n lim 1"

\end_inset

) involves derivatives of these functions of very high order with respect
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 is analytic; thus the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are also analytic in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the high-order derivatives, we need an elementary result from
 complex analysis.
 The asymptotic growth of high-order derivatives of an analytic function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 is determined by the location of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The required result can be derived by the following elementary argument.
 Consider the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{n}f/dz^{n}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

, and assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 admits an expansion around the singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 nearest to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(z)=c_{0}+c_{1}\left(z-z_{*}\right)^{s}+...,\label{eq:f sing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $s\neq0,1,2,...$
\end_inset

 is the power of the leading-order singularity, and the omitted terms are
 either higher powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $z-z_{*}$
\end_inset

 or singularities at points 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 located further away from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 The singularity structure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:f sing"

\end_inset

) yields the large-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 asymptotics
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{d^{n}f}{dz^{n}}\right|_{z=0}\negmedspace\approx c_{1}(-z_{*})^{s}\frac{\Gamma(n-s)}{\Gamma(-s)}z_{*}^{-n}+...\label{eq:large-n derivative}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This formula enables one to evaluate large-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 limits such as Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:p n'n lim 1"

\end_inset

).
 It can be seen from this formula that any other singular point 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 located further away from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 gives a contribution that is smaller by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z_{*}^{\prime}/z_{*}\right|^{s-n}$
\end_inset

.
 The contribution of a subdominant singularity of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z-z_{*}\right)^{s'}$

\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 but with a higher power 
\begin_inset Formula $s'>s$

, is suppressed, in comparison with the term in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

), by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Gamma(n-s')}{\Gamma(n-s)}\frac{\Gamma(-s)}{\Gamma(-s')}\approx\frac{1}{\left(n-1\right)^{s'-s}}\frac{\Gamma(-s)}{\Gamma(-s')}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is clear that the terms omitted from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:large-n derivative"

\end_inset

) indeed give subleading contributions at large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and so Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:large-n derivative"

\end_inset

) is indeed the leading asymptotic term at 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To proceed, we need to determine the location of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 is obtained as an intersection of a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{1/n_{3}}$
\end_inset

 and a straight line 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\kappa_{33}F$
\end_inset

, there will be a value 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x_{*}$
\end_inset

 where the straight line is tangent to the curve.
 At this value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

 has a singularity of the type
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(x)=F(x_{*})+F_{1}\sqrt{x-x_{*}}+O(x-x_{*}),\label{eq:F sqrt}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a constant that can be easily determined; we omit further details that
 will not be required below.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 is found from the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $dF/dx$
\end_inset

 diverge at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $dF/dx$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq x_{*}$
\end_inset

 is found as the derivative of the inverse function, or by taking the derivative
 of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:F def"

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dF}{dx}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n_{3}}F^{\frac{1}{n_{3}}-1}-\Gamma_{33}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This expression diverges at the values 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
F(x_{*}) & =\left(n_{3}\kappa_{33}\right)^{-\frac{n_{3}}{n_{3}-1}},\\
x_{*} & =\left(n_{3}-1\right)\kappa_{33}F(x_{*})=\kappa_{33}\frac{n_{3}-1}{n_{3}^{n_{3}/(n_{3}-1)}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{33}\approx1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}\gg1$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{*}$
\end_inset

 is a constant of order 1.

 of the mean number of bubbles of types 1 and 2 at fixed total number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_inset Formula

The derivatives

 For instance, we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{q}g_{1}$

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\partial g_{1}(z,q)}{\partial q}\right|_{q=1}=F^{\prime}(\kappa_{31}z^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z^{Z_{2}})\kappa_{31}Z_{1}z^{Z_{1}}.\label{eq:dg1 dq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is clear that the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{q}g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{q}g_{2}$
\end_inset

 have a singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $x=x_{*}$
\end_inset

 of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{31}z_{*}^{Z_{1}}+\kappa_{32}z_{*}^{Z_{2}}=x_{*}.\label{eq:z star equ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let us analyze this equation in order to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 If the nucleation rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{31}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{32}$

 differ by many orders of magnitude, we may expect that one of the terms

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{31}z_{*}^{Z_{1}}$

 Then the value

 is well approximated by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z_{*}\approx\left(\frac{x_{*}}{\kappa_{31}}\right)^{1/Z_{1}}.\label{eq:z star ans}

\end_inset

This approximation is justified if the first term in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula

 If neither Eq.

 Qualitatively this means that the RV measure rewards bubbles with a larger

The RV measure prescription as formulated in the previous section applies
 only to the calculation of abundances of terminal bubbles.
 We will now extend the RV measure to computing arbitrary statistics on

We first note that RV measure prescription can be applied, strictly speaking,

vacua from which no further tunneling is possible).
 However, this limitation is quite benign, for two reasons.
 First, a landscape without any Minkowski or AdS states is not expected
 to be realized in any realistic string theory scenario without an exceptional
 amount of fine-tuning.
 Second, the previously proposed volume-based and the world-line based measure
 prescriptions agree for a landscape without terminal bubble types

 One may therefore consider the measure problem as solved in such landscapes
 and turn one's attention to more realistic landscapes where terminal bubble
 types are present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take an initial bubble of a nonterminal type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and consider the statistical ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

 of all possible evolutions of the initial bubble such that the total number
 of nucleated bubbles of all types is finite and equals 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (not counting the initial bubble).
 The total number of nucleated bubbles in a multiverse can be finite only
 if terminal bubbles nucleate everywhere and merge globally to the future
 of the initial bubble.
 This can happen by rare chance; however, it is important the total probability
 of all events in the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

 is always nonzero for any given 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 are well-defined and nonempty.

 The ensemble consists of all trees that have a total number

 The trees in

 are finite because all the

 The motivation for considering the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

 is that a finite but very large tree (with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 large) is a controlled approximation to infinite trees that typically occur.
 Hence, we are motivated to consider 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$

\begin_inset Formula $n$

 finite but very large.

\begin_layout Standard
Once the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

 is defined, one may consider the statistical distribution of some cosmological
 observable within the multiverses belonging to the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, one can count the number of bubbles of some type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, or the number of observers within bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, or the number of observations of some physical process, etc.
 In a very large multiverse belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}(j)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\gg1$
\end_inset

, one may expect that the statistics of observations will be independent
 of the initial bubble type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, this will be one of the results of this chapter.
 Hence, let us suppress the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and write simply 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each multiverse belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 has a naturally defined probability weight, which is simply equal to the
 probability of realizing that multiverse.
 This probability weight needs to be taken into account when computing the
 statistical distributions of observables.
 The sum of all probability weights of multiverses within 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the total probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

, which is exponentially small for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 but always nonzero.
 Since the multiverses from the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 are by construction finite, 
\emph on
i.e.

 we are assured that any statistics we desire to compute on 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$

 will be well-defined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now consider the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q|E_{n})$

 of some interesting observable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 within the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 and take the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 One expects that the probability distribution

 will have a well-defined limit for large

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is well-defined for a simplest toy landscape as well as in the case of
 random-walk eternal inflation.
 In this work I extend these results to a general landscape scenario.
 Below (Sec.

\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 as long as the initial bubble is not of terminal type and as long as the
 landscape is irreducible (every vacuum can be reached from every other
 non-terminal vacuum by a chain of nucleations).
 Thus, the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q)$
\end_inset

 is unique and well-defined.
 This distribution is the final result of applying the RV prescription to
 the observable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

In practice, it is necessary to compute the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q|E_{n})$
\end_inset

 asymptotically in the limit of large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 A direct numerical calculation of probabilities in that limit by enumerating
 all possible evolution trees is extremely difficult because of the exponential
 growth of the number of possible evolutions.
 Instead, I derive explicit formulas for the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(Q)$
\end_inset

 in a generic landscape by evaluating the limit

 ends globally.
 These probabilities are extremely small and of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{FA}^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{IB}^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This is easy to interpret because, for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{FA}^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the probability of nucleating 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 terminal regions at once after one Hubble time within an 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region of type 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the generating functions for the finitely produced distribution
 of bubbles are given by the solution branch having 
\begin_inset Formula $F\ll1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I\ll1$
\end_inset

 rather than by the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $F=I=1$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

.
 More precisely, the physically meaningful solution 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z),I(z)$
\end_inset

 is selected by the asymptotic behavior
\begin_inset space ~

 This argument removes the ambiguity inherent in solving Eqs.

\begin_layout Standard
Once the main branch of the generating functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\{q_{j}\};k)$
\end_inset

 are known, one can express the mean number of bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=F,I,A,B$
\end_inset

) at a fixed total number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(i|n_{\text{tot}})\equiv\frac{\left\langle n_{i}\right\rangle _{n_{\text{tot}}}}{n_{\text{tot}}}=\frac{\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}\partial_{q_{i}}g(z=0,\left\{ q_{j}=1\right\} ;k)}{n_{\text{tot}}\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}g(z=0,\left\{ q_{j}=1\right\} ;k)}.\label{eq:p n' n lim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

One expects that the limit of this ratio at 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 will be independent of the initial bubble type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n_{\text{tot}}}$
\end_inset

 will consist of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions having a very long evolution, so that the initial conditions are
 forgotten.
 Below I will show explicitly that this is indeed the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is more convenient to compute the ratios of the number of bubbles of
 types 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i'$
\end_inset

 at fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{p(i|n_{\text{tot}})}{p(i'|n_{\text{tot}})}=\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}\partial_{q_{i}}g}{\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}\partial_{q_{i'}}g}\right|_{z=0,\left\{ q_{j}=1\right\} }.\label{eq:i i' ratio ntot}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then one only needs to compute derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{q_{i}}g\equiv g_{,q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}=1$
\end_inset

.
 These derivatives satisfy a system of 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 equations that can be easily derived from Eqs.
\begin_inset space ~

LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:F equ 1"

\end_inset

)–(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 For instance, the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{A}}$
\end_inset

 satisfy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\nu}F^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}F_{,q_{A}} & =z\kappa_{FA}+z\kappa_{FI}I_{,q_{A}}+\kappa_{FF}F_{,q_{A}},\\
\frac{1}{\nu}I^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}I_{,q_{A}} & =z\kappa_{IF}F_{,q_{A}}+\kappa_{II}I_{,q_{A}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

Rewriting these equations in a matrix form, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{\nu}F^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}-\kappa_{FF} & -z\kappa_{FI}\\
-z\kappa_{IF} & \frac{1}{\nu}I^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}-\kappa_{II}
\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
F_{,q_{A}}\\

\begin_inset Formula $z$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can verify using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is invertible near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FIqA eqs"

\end_inset

) can be written, at least within some range of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 remains invertible, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
F_{,q_{A}}\\
I_{,q_{A}}
\end{array}\right]=\hat{M}^{-1}(z)\left[\begin{array}{c}
z\kappa_{FA}\\
0
\end{array}\right].\label{eq:FqA eq 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{F}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{F}}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(z)\left[\begin{array}{c}
F_{,q_{F}}\\
I_{,q_{F}}

z\kappa_{IF}F

\end_inset

whose solution is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
F_{,q_{F}}\\
I_{,q_{F}}
\end{array}\right]=\hat{M}^{-1}(z)\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
z\kappa_{IF}F
\end{array}\right].\label{eq:FqF eq 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Other generating functions can be expressed in the same manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could in principle obtain a numerical solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, and all the other generating functions at any given value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 However, the numerical solution is not particularly useful at this point
 because the next step in the calculation is the evaluation of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:i i' ratio ntot"

\end_inset

) in the limit of very large 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

, for instance,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{p(A|n_{\text{tot}})}{p(F|n_{\text{tot}})}=\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}F_{,q_{A}}}{\partial_{z}^{n_{\text{tot}}}F_{,q_{F}}}\right|_{z=0}.\label{eq:ratio a to f}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is generally not feasible to compute the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th derivative of a numerically obtained function in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, because the unavoidable round-off errors are amplified by a fixed factor
 with each successive numerical differentiation.
 Therefore, we need a way to evaluate the ratio
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:i i' ratio ntot"

\end_inset

) in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 without using numerics.
 Indeed we will be able to compute the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A)/p(F)$
\end_inset

.
 We will also show that, for instance,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{p(A)}{p(F)}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n}F_{,q_{A}}}{\partial_{z}^{n}F_{,q_{F}}}\right|_{z=0}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n}I_{,q_{A}}}{\partial_{z}^{n}I_{,q_{F}}}\right|_{z=0};\label{eq:ratio a to f lim}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in other words, that the final RV-regulated ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $p(A)/p(F)$
\end_inset

 is independent of whether the initial bubble is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 or of type 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To proceed, we use the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{F}}(z)$
\end_inset

, etc.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

are analytic functions of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The asymptotic growth of high-order derivatives of an analytic function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 is determined by the location of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 plane, as shown in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now need to determine the location of the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

, etc., as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 This task is much simplified once we observe that all these quantities
 are expressed through the inverse matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

, and hence it remains to analyze the singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 That matrix can be singular at some value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 either because some of the coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 are singular, or because the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is degenerate (noninvertible) at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 depend on solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z),I(z)$
\end_inset

 of algebraic equations
\begin_inset space ~

) at 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 and thus cannot be divergent as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 These coefficients can be singular only in that some derivative in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 diverges.
 The derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,z}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(z)\left[\begin{array}{c}

\kappa_{FA}+\kappa_{FI}I\\
\kappa_{IB}+\kappa_{IF}F
\end{array}\right].\label{eq:equations for FI derivatives}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,z}$
\end_inset

 diverge only for those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is degenerate.
 For these 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, all the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,z}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $I_{,z}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}$
\end_inset

, etc.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

will be divergent at the same time since they are all proportional to the
 inverse matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

 As long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate, all the different branches of the solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z),I(z)$
\end_inset

 do not meet and remain smooth functions of

 As we noted above, the

\begin_inset Formula $F(z),I(z)$

\begin_inset Formula $z\approx0$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 remain smooth functions of

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is nondenegerate.
 We conclude that the only possible singularities of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z),I(z)$

 are those values

\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)=0$

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 with the same asymptotic behavior, namely proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z_{*}-z\right)^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 We may express the inverse matrix as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{M}^{-1}(z) & =\frac{1}{\det\hat{M}(z)}\hat{\tilde{M}}(z),\\
\hat{\tilde{M}}(z) & \equiv\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tilde{M}}\equiv\hat{M}^{-1}\det\hat{M}$
\end_inset

, which remains well-defined at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 It then follows from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FqA eq 1"

\end_inset

) that the asymptotic behavior of the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{,q_{A}}(z)$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}

z_{*}^{2}\kappa_{IF}\kappa_{FA}

\end{align}

\end_inset

Similarly, using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula

\left(\frac{1}{\nu}F^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}-\kappa_{FF}\right)z_{*}\kappa_{IF}F

\end_inset

 Using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dependent factors are the same in 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}^{n}F_{,q_{A}}$
\end_inset

 and other such derivatives, we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n}F_{,q_{A}}}{\partial_{z}^{n}F_{,q_{F}}}\right|_{z=0} & =F^{\frac{1}{\nu}}\frac{\left(\frac{1}{\nu}I_{*}^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}-\kappa_{II}\right)\kappa_{FA}}{z_{*}\kappa_{FI}\kappa_{IF}F_{*}},\\
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left.\frac{\partial_{z}^{n}I_{,q_{A}}}{\partial_{z}^{n}I_{,q_{F}}}\right|_{z=0} & =\frac{z_{*}\kappa_{FA}}{\left(\frac{1}{\nu}F_{*}^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}-\kappa_{FF}\right)F_{*}}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

It is important that the two limits above are equal; this is so because
 the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\det\hat{M}=\left[\frac{F_{*}^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}}{\nu}-\kappa_{FF}\right]\negmedspace\left[\frac{I_{*}^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}}{\nu}-\kappa_{II}\right]-z_{*}^{2}\kappa_{FI}\kappa_{IF}=0,\label{eq:det M equ 0}

\end_inset

where we denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{*}\equiv F(z_{*})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{*}\equiv I(z_{*})$
\end_inset

 for brevity.
 It follows that the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bubbles to 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

-bubbles is independent of whether the initial bubble is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

 In other words, the RV-regulated ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-bubbles to 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

-bubbles is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 To determine

 We are interested in the solution

 By definition

Moreover, we can show that the solutions

 Initially at

 these functions have the form

 One can then find from Eq.

 It is then evident from Eq.

 Therefore, the solutions

 Eventually the product of the square brackets in Eq.

Since the physically significant branch of the solution involves always

 also at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 Then the terms

These solutions are obtained under the assumption that the terms

\end_inset

We need to check whether

 Using Eq.

This value is within the range

Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 the quantity in Eq.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta\equiv\left(\frac{\kappa_{IB}}{\kappa_{FA}}\right)^{\nu+1}\frac{\kappa_{FI}}{\kappa_{IF}},

\end_inset

then Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\left|\ln\eta\right|<6$
\end_inset

 One would expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 is generically either very large or very small, so the inequalities
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Additionally, we need to require 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z_{*}\ll\min\left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{FA}},\frac{1}{\kappa_{IB}}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which entails
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\kappa_{IB}}{\kappa_{IF}}\ll\nu\sqrt{\eta},\quad\frac{\kappa_{FA}}{\kappa_{FI}}\ll\frac{\nu}{\sqrt{\eta}}.\label{eq:regime 1 extra}

However, this requirement is weaker than Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{FA}\ll\kappa_{FI}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{IB}\ll\kappa_{IF}$

\begin_inset Formula

 Then we use Eq.

Due to the fine-tuning assumption
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_layout Standard
Having considered the fine-tuned case, let us now turn to the generic case.
 Generically one would expect that the quantity

 logarithmically narrow range 
\begin_inset Formula $[e^{-6},e^{6}]$

 In that case, one of the inequalities
\begin_inset space ~

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)\neq0$

 To reach the value 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z_{*})=0$

\begin_inset Formula $z$

 further, until one of the terms

\begin_inset Formula

Hence, the determinant

 first vanishes at the value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

 Without loss of generality, we may relabel the vacua (

 In the range of

\begin_inset Formula

With these values of

\begin_inset space ~

This range is nonempty if

\end_inset

Substituting this value into the inequalities
\begin_inset space ~

 (The relabeling

It remains to justify the statement of Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 I will demonstrate that the property
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:det M sing 1"

\end_inset

) holds for a general landscape.
 Here only a simple argument is presented to illustrate this property for
 Eqs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:F equ 2 s"

\end_inset

)–(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:I equ 2 s"

\end_inset

).
 Using those equations, we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{*}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{*}$
\end_inset

 and derive a closed algebraic equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{*}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{*}=z^{\nu}\left[\kappa_{FA}+\kappa_{FI}z^{\nu}\left(\kappa_{IB}+\kappa_{IF}F_{*}\right)^{\nu}\right]^{\nu}\equiv f(z;F_{*}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The solution 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)$
\end_inset

 is given by the intersection of the line 
\begin_inset Formula $y=F$
\end_inset

 and the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $y=f(z;F)$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y-F$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z;F)$
\end_inset

 is convex in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F>0,z>0$
\end_inset

; hence, there will be a value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 for which the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z_{*};F)$
\end_inset

 is tangent to the line 
\begin_inset Formula $y=F$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $f_{,F}(z_{*};F_{*})=1$
\end_inset

.
 This value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 will then implicitly determine 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 For values 
\begin_inset Formula $F\approx F_{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

 the dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 will exhibit the singularity behavior of the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{z_{*}-z}$
\end_inset

.
 To see this formally, we may expand
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
F & =f(z;F)\approx F_{*}+f_{,F}\left(F-F_{*}\right)+\frac{1}{2}f_{,FF}\left(F-F_{*}\right)^{2}\nonumber \\
 & +f_{,z}\left(z-z_{*}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{,F}(z_{*};F_{*})=1$
\end_inset

, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F\approx F_{*}+\left.\frac{2f_{,z}}{f_{,FF}}\right|_{F_{*},z_{*}}\sqrt{z_{*}-z}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This shows explicitly the singularity structure of the form
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 is a smooth function of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I(z)$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 as a function only of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, we obtain for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

 the required formula
\begin_inset space ~

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\det\hat{M}(z)\approx\left(F-F_{*}\right)\left.\frac{d}{dF}\right|_{F_{*}}\det\hat{M}\propto\sqrt{z_{*}-z}.

Boltzmann brains

To be specific, let us fix

 Consider the probability

\end_inset

 of having a finite total number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

 of bubbles of which 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{F}$

\begin_inset Formula $F$

 The number of

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{F}^{BB}$

 A generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

For the initial bubble types 
\begin_inset Formula $k=F$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(z,q,r)\equiv g(z,q,r;F),\quad I(z,q,r)\equiv g(z,q,r;I).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The generating functions

\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,N_{r}$

 Let us denote these

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_inset

These quantities are conveniently represented by an

-dimensional vector, which we will denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|h_{j}(z)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 using the Dirac notation (although no connection to quantum mechanics is
 present here).
 This vector satisfies an inhomogeneous linear equation that follows straightfor
wardly by taking the derivative

\end_inset

while the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ki}(z)$
\end_inset

 is defined by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(z)\equiv M_{ki}(z)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}, & k=i;\\

 Moreover, the (left and right) eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue

 At the same time, all the other eigenvalues of

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{0}(z)=c_{1}\sqrt{z_{*}-z}+O(z_{*}-z),\quad c_{1}>0.\label{eq:lambda0 asympt}

One can see from the small-

 asymptotics
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$

 contains very large positive numbers on the diagonal and very small negative
 numbers off the diagonal.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 for all sufficiently small 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 Since the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 remain nonzero except for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 that first vanishes at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 remains positive for all 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<z_{*}$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is the smallest positive value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we restrict our attention to 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<z_{*}$
\end_inset

, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

 exists.
 We need to analyze the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We treat 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 as an operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

-dimensional real space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 is not symmetric and may not be diagonalizable.
 Instead of diagonalizing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

, we split the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 into the 1-dimensional subspace corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

, and into the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N_{r}-1\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional complement subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate.
 Thus, we may symbolically write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(z)=\lambda_{0}(z)\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle \left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|+\hat{M}_{1}(z),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v^{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 are the right and the left eigenvectors corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

, normalized such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle u^{0}|v^{0}\right\rangle =1,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and it is implied that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}_{1}(z)$
\end_inset

 vanishes on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v^{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 but is nonsingular on the complement space 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{M}\left|v^{0}\right\rangle  & =\lambda_{0}\left|v_{0}\right\rangle ,\quad\left\langle u^{0}\right|\hat{M}=\lambda_{0}\left\langle u^{0}\right|,\\
\hat{M}_{1}\left|v^{0}\right\rangle  & =0,\quad\left\langle u^{0}\right|\hat{M}_{1}=0.
\end{align}

\end_inset

There exists a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}_{1(V_{1})}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 that acts as the inverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}_{1}$
\end_inset

 when restricted to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and again vanishes on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v^{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Using that matrix, we may write the inverse matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 explicitly as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}^{-1}(z)=\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle \left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|+\hat{M}_{1(V_{1})}^{-1}(z).\label{eq:M inverse}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, the solution
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:h sol M Q"

\end_inset

) can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|h_{j}(z)\right\rangle =\frac{\left\langle u^{0}|Q_{j}\right\rangle }{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left|v^{0}\right\rangle +\hat{M}_{1(V_{1})}^{-1}\left|Q_{j}\right\rangle .\label{eq:hj lambda0 ans}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now it is clear from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lambda0 asympt"

\end_inset

) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|h_{j}(z)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 diverges at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\left(z_{*}-z\right)^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 It also follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|h_{j}(z)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 does not diverge at any smaller real 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 cannot vanish at some 
\emph on
complex
\emph default
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that is closer to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*}^{\prime})=0$
\end_inset

 with a complex-valued 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, then a derivative of the generating function, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g(z;j)$
\end_inset

, would diverge at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the definition
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g general def"

\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}=1$
\end_inset

, we find that the following sum diverges,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\partial g(z;j)}{\partial z}\right|_{z=z_{*}^{\prime}}=\sum_{n\geq1}\left(z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{n-1}np(n;j)=\infty.\label{eq:series for dgdz}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The sum of absolute values is not smaller than the above, and hence also
 diverges:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{\partial g(z;j)}{\partial z}\right|_{z=\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|}=\sum_{n\geq1}\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|^{n-1}np(n;j)=\infty.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g$
\end_inset

 has also a singularity at a 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 As we have shown, 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is the smallest such real-valued singularity point; hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|\geq z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the radius of convergence of the series
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:series for dgdz"

\end_inset

), which is a Taylor series for the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g$
\end_inset

.
 There remains the possibility that a singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is located directly on the circle of convergence, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}=z_{*}e^{\text{i}\phi}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\phi<2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This possibility can be excluded using the following argument.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g$
\end_inset

 can have only finitely many singularities on the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|=z_{*}$
\end_inset

; infinitely many singularities on the circle would indicate an accumulation
 point which would be an essential singularity, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

not a branch point.
 However, by construction 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 is an algebraic function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that cannot have singularities other than branch points.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 is regular at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, all branch points of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 must be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z-z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{s}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

.
 Using the explicit formula
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:large-n derivative"

\end_inset

) for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th derivative of an analytic function with a branch cut singularity of
 the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z-z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{s}$
\end_inset

, we find that the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $np(n;j)$
\end_inset

 of the Taylor series
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:series for dgdz"

\end_inset

) decay at large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 asymptotically as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
np(n;j) & =\frac{1}{n!}\partial_{z}^{n}\partial_{z}g\propto\frac{\Gamma(n+1-s)}{\Gamma(n+1)}\left(z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{-n}\left(1+O(n^{-1})\right)\nonumber \\
 & \propto n^{-s}\left(z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{-n}\left(1+O(n^{-1})\right).\label{eq:sing contrib}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 has a finite number of singularities 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}=z_{*}e^{\text{i}\phi}$
\end_inset

 on the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|=z_{*}$
\end_inset

, and each singularity gives a contribution of the form
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sing contrib"

\end_inset

).
 Hence, we may estimate (for sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, say for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq n_{0}$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
np(n;j)=c_{0}n^{-s}z_{*}^{-n}\left(1+O(n^{-1})\right),\quad c_{0}>0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the partial sum for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq n_{0}$
\end_inset

 of the series
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:series for dgdz"

\end_inset

) is estimated by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\sum_{n\geq n_{0}}\left(z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{n-1}np(n;j) & \approx\sum_{n\geq n_{0}}\left(z_{*}^{\prime}\right)^{n-1}c_{0}n^{-s}z_{*}^{-n}\nonumber \\
 & =\frac{c_{0}}{z_{*}}\sum_{n\geq n_{0}}n^{-s}e^{\text{i}n\phi}.
\end{align}

\end_inset

The latter series converges for 
\begin_inset Formula $s>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\phi<2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 (The neglected terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1-s}$
\end_inset

 build an absolutely convergent series and hence introduce an arbitrarily
 small error into the estimate.) Therefore, the series
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:series for dgdz"

\end_inset

) also converges at 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}\neq z_{*}$
\end_inset

, contradicting the assumption that other singularities exist on the circle
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude from these arguments that the singularity of

\end_inset

 nearest to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}^{\prime}$

 satisfy the strict inequality 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z_{*}^{\prime}\right|>z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The same statement about the locations of singularities holds for the generatin

\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;j)$

\begin_layout Standard
To compute the final expression
\begin_inset space ~

 To this end, we use the formula

\end_inset

 nearest to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

 We have just found that this singularity is at a real value

h_{j}(z;i)\approx\frac{1}{c_{1}\sqrt{z_{*}-z}}\left\langle u^{0}|Q_{j}\right\rangle v_{i}^{0},\quad z\approx z_{*},\label{eq:hj Qj asympt ans}

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since the component

 Hence, Eq.

This is the main formula for the RV-regulated relative abundances of bubbles

 For a terminal type 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in T$

We note that the expression

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};j)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}^{0}(z_{*})$
\end_inset

 remains quite difficult.
 The outline of the required computations is as follows: One first needs
 to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 asymptotic given by Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 determine the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ij}(z)$
\end_inset

 using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Then one needs to find the smallest value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}>0$
\end_inset

 such that the determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 vanishes.
 Finally, one needs to compute a left eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}(z_{*})\right|$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z_{*})$
\end_inset

.
 The mathematical construction shown below guarantees that 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 exists and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}(z_{*})\right|$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate and has all positive components; the results are independent
 of the normalization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 However, a brute-force numerical computation of these quantities appears
 to be impossible due to the huge number 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

 of the simultaneous equations
\begin_inset space ~

 Even the numerical value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is likely to be too large to be represented efficiently in computers.
 In the next section we will consider an example landscape where an analytic
 approximation can be found.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};k)$
\end_inset

, we need to follow the main branch 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;k)$
\end_inset

 as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is increased from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 until 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 vanishes, which will determine the value 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the asymptotic form
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main branch landscape"

) is valid in some range near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;k)\ll1$
\end_inset

 at those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is dominated by large positive diagonal terms 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;k)\delta_{kj}$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 increases to 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

, all the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 also increase while 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 decreases monotonically to zero (this statement is proved rigorously in
 Sec.
\begin_inset space ~

 One can visualize the changes in the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 if one notes that the positive diagonal terms decrease with 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 while the negative off-diagonal terms (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{jk}=-z\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq k$
\end_inset

) grow in magnitude.
 Eventually 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 vanishes at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

 such that the off-diagonal terms become sufficiently large at least in
 some rows and columns of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)\equiv g(z,\left\{ q_{i}=1\right\} ;j)$
\end_inset

 This will be the case if the term 
\begin_inset Formula $z\sum_{i\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}$

 Denoting for brevity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}\equiv\sum_{i\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

the total transition probability from 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 to all terminal vacua, we have therefore the conditions (for every 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}\gg g(z;k),\quad z\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}\gg z\negmedspace\sum_{i\not\in T,i\neq k}\negmedspace\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}g(z;i).\label{eq:z bound regime 1 pre}
\end{equation}

These conditions are satisfied, consistently with Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $z$

 is bounded (for every

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z\ll\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}^{-1},\quad z\ll\left[\sum_{i\not\in T,i\neq k}\negmedspace\frac{\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}}{\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}}\kappa_{i\rightarrow T}^{\nu}\right]^{-\frac{1}{\nu}}.\label{eq:z bound regime 1}

 Then the second bound in Eq.

 remains nonzero for these

 In a general landscape, one expects the analogous fine-tuning to be much
 stronger or even impossible to satisfy.
 In other words, one expects that the functions

, chapter 7).
 For each of the diagonal elements 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{kk}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,N_{r}$
\end_inset

 one needs to draw a circle in the complex 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 plane, centered at the diagonal element 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{kk}$
\end_inset

 with radius 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{k}\equiv\sum_{i\neq k}\left|M_{ki}\right|.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

 circles 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\lambda-M_{kk}\right|\leq\rho_{k},\quad k=1,...,N_{r},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 called the Gershgorin circles.
 The Gershgorin theorem says that all the eigenvalues of a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{jk}$
\end_inset

 are located within the union of these circles.
 An elementary proof is as follows.
 An eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 can be normalized such that its component of largest absolute value is
 equal to 1.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 be this component (renumbering the components if necessary), then it is
 easy to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is within a circle with center 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{11}$
\end_inset

 and radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Namely, we start from the eigenvalue equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i\neq1}M_{1i}v_{i}+M_{11}v_{1}=\lambda v_{1},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and use the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v_{i}\right|\leq1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq1$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\lambda-M_{11}\right|=\left|\sum_{i\neq1}M_{1i}v_{i}\right|\leq\sum_{i\neq1}\left|M_{1i}\right|=\rho_{1}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Applying the theorem to the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 at small 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 such that Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:main branch landscape"

\end_inset

) is a good approximation for the generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

, we find that the Gershgorin circles are centered at large positive values
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{kk}=\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}\approx\frac{1}{\nu}\frac{1}{\left(z\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}\right)^{\nu-1}}\gg1,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

while the radii of the circles are small, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{k}=z\sum_{i\neq k,i\not\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}\ll1.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Hence, for small 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 none of the circles can contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

, so the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 increases, the radii 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{k}$
\end_inset

 increase while the centers 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{kk}$
\end_inset

 move monotonically towards zero.
 The circle closest to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 is the one with the center closest to zero and the largest radius.
 This circle is labeled by 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with largest rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}$
\end_inset

.
 This value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the high-energy vacua in the landscape, for which tunneling
 to any other vacua is much easier than for low-energy vacua.
 Therefore the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 will be located inside the Gershgorin circle(s) centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{kk}(z_{*})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 corresponding to high-energy vacua.
 The Gershgorin circle to which the eigenvalue belongs indicates the largest
 component of the eigenvector.
 Hence, one expects that the eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}(z_{*})\right|$
\end_inset

 has the largest values of its components 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}^{0}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the high-energy vacua 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The Gershgorin theorem requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 be inside the circle centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{kk}(z_{*})$
\end_inset

 with radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{k}(z_{*})$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{kk}(z_{*})=\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z_{*};k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}\leq z_{*}\sum_{i\neq k,i\not\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Disregarding the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}$
\end_inset

, which are small in comparison with the remaining terms, and using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:g equ for q1"

\end_inset

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};k)$
\end_inset

 we obtain the following condition,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z_{*}^{\nu}\geq\frac{1}{\nu}\frac{\left[\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}+\sum_{i\neq k,i\not\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}g(z_{*};i)\right]^{1-\nu}}{\sum_{i\neq k,i\not\in T}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Proceeding further requires at least an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};i)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, which is so far not available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we are as yet unable to obtain an explicit estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 for an arbitrary landscape, let us consider a workable example that is
 more realistic than the FABI model.
 In this example there is a single high-energy vacuum, labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

, and a large number of dS low-energy vacua, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2,...,N_{r}$
\end_inset

, as well as a number of terminal vacua, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N_{r}+1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that the downward tunneling rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{1\rightarrow i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq1$
\end_inset

 are much larger than the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{i\rightarrow1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{i\rightarrow j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j\neq1$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;1)\gg g(z;i)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq1$
\end_inset

, and so the first Gershgorin circle is the one closest to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence we may expect that the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 always belongs to that circle.
 Moreover, it is likely that 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$
\end_inset

 is within the regime
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $k\neq1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k=1$

 We will now proceed with the calculation and later check that these assumptions
 are self-consistent.

This approximate matrix is much easier to analyze; in particular, its determinan
t and the eigenvectors can be computed in closed form.
 The determinant of this matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\det\hat{M}(z)\approx M_{11}...M_{N_{r}N_{r}}\left[1-\sum_{i=2}^{N_{r}}\frac{z^{2}\kappa_{1\rightarrow i}\kappa_{i\rightarrow1}}{M_{11}(z)M_{ii}(z)}\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z_{*})=0$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{11}(z_{*})\approx z_{*}^{2}\negmedspace\sum_{i=2}^{N_{r}}\frac{\kappa_{1\rightarrow i}\kappa_{i\rightarrow1}}{M_{ii}(z_{*})}.

The last ratio is always very close to 1 since typically 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{*};j)\ll1$

 In particular,

 for vacua

 The number of ordinary observers per one

 and the generating functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq j$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this end, we equate two expressions for the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle z^{n_{\text{tot}}}\prod_{i}q_{i}^{n_{i}}\right\rangle _{n_{\text{tot}}<\infty;j}$
\end_inset

.
 The first expression is the left-hand side of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The second expression is found by considering the

\end_inset

 daughter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions evolved out of the initial 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-region and by using the fact that the same average for a daughter region
 of type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset

.
 However, two details need to be accounted for: First, the generating functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset

 evaluated for the daughter regions do not count the daughter bubbles themselves.
 Second, the type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of each of the daughter regions is a random quantity.
 Before deriving a general relationship, let us illustrate the procedure
 using an example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that, say, only two of the daughter regions change their
 type to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 while all other daughter regions retain the initial bubble type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Denote temporarily by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{kkj...j}$
\end_inset

 the probability of this event; binomial combinatorics yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{kkj...j}=\frac{\nu!}{2!(\nu-2)!}\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}^{2}\kappa_{j\rightarrow j}^{\nu-2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the average of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{n_{\text{tot}}}\prod_{i}q_{i}^{n_{i}}$
\end_inset

 receives a contribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{kkj...j}z^{2}q_{k}^{2}\left[g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)\right]^{2}\left[g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;j)\right]^{2-\nu}\label{eq:combinatorial example}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

from this event.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}$
\end_inset

 describes two additional bubbles that contribute to 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{tot}}$
\end_inset

; the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}^{2}$
\end_inset

 accounts for two additional bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

; no factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 appear since no additional bubbles of type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 are generated.
 Finally, the powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 account for all the bubbles generated in the daughter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions, but these generating functions do not count the daughter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions themselves.
 Those daughter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions are explicitly counted by the extra factors 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}q_{k}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute the average, we need to add the contributions from all the possible
 events of this kind.
 Since all of the daughter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

-regions are independent and statistically equivalent, the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle z^{n_{\text{tot}}}\prod_{i}q_{i}^{n_{i}}\right\rangle _{n_{\text{tot}}<\infty;j}$
\end_inset

 splits into the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 averages, each evaluated over a single daughter region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The average over a single daughter region of type 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 has contribution from transitions to other types 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq j$
\end_inset

 and a contribution from the event of no transition.
 Let us first consider a 
\emph on
terminal
\emph default
 type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 With probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}$
\end_inset

 a given daughter region becomes a vacuum of type 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Thereafter, no more bubbles will be nucleated inside it; the average of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle z^{n_{\text{tot}}}\prod_{i}q_{i}^{n_{i}}\right\rangle _{n_{\text{tot}}<\infty;j}$
\end_inset

 over that daughter region is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $zq_{k}$
\end_inset

, meaning that there is a total of one bubbles and only one bubble of type
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the contribution of that event to the statistical average is 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}zq_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us consider a nonterminal type 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq j$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k\not\in T$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding contribution to the average is 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}zq_{k}g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset

.
 Since we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\equiv1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is a terminal bubble type, we may write the contribution as 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{j\rightarrow k}zq_{k}g(z,\left\{ q_{i}\right\} ;k)$
\end_inset

 for both terminal and nonterminal types 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we consider the case of

 In the actual multiverse, one has bubbles of spherical shape that can intersect

The irreducibility condition means, in the context of landscape models,
 that any two recyclable vacua in the landscape can be connected by a chain
 of transitions with nonzero nucleation rates.

 Note that a nonzero transition probability from vacuum

 a nonnegative matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}>0$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 The same property holds for the relevant left eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 (the matrix need not be symmetric, so the left and the right eigenvectors
 do not, in general, coincide).
 Therefore it is possible to choose the eigenvectors

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v^{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 such that the normalization 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}|v^{0}\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

 holds.
 This normalization will be convenient for further calculations, and so
 we assume that such eigenvectors have been chosen.

It follows that

 are located within the circle 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mu-\lambda\right|\leq\alpha_{0}$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}>0$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 are strictly to the right (in the complex plane) of the real eigenvalue
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$

 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$

 is the eigenvalue of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restoring now the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 always has a real, nondegenerate eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

, which is at the same time the eigenvalue with the algebraically smallest
 real part among all the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 for sufficiently small 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 for those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 will remain positive as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

, since no other eigenvalue can become negative unless 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 first becomes negative.
 We will now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 cannot remain positive for all real 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

 It will then follow by continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$

\begin_inset Formula $z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$

We will use the property that the inverse matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$

 has all positive elements as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 (equivalently if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}<\mu$
\end_inset

 The derivation of this property is simple: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}^{-1}={(\mu\hat{1}-\hat{A})}^{-1}=\mu^{-1}\hat{1}+\mu^{-2}\hat{A}+\mu^{-3}\hat{A}^{2}+...,\label{eq:M inv series}

\end_inset

which yields explicitly a matrix with all nonnegative elements.
 [The matrix-valued series in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:M inv series"

\end_inset

) converges because all the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 are strictly smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 by absolute value.] Moreover, the irreducibility condition means that some
 chain of transitions will connect every pair of recyclable vacua; this
 is equivalent to saying that for any vacua 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 there exists some integer 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{s}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula ${(\hat{A}^{s})}_{ij}$

 Hence, every matrix element of

Further, we can deduce that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 is a strictly increasing, real-valued function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 To show this, we consider the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 whose components are the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

 derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g(z;j)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N_{r}$

 It follows from Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:g general equ"

\end_inset

) that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 satisfies the inhomogeneous equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(z)\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle =\left|\zeta\right\rangle ,\label{eq:dzg equ}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 the vector with the components 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\zeta_{k}(z)\equiv\sum_{i\neq k}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}g(z;i).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The solution of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle =\hat{M}^{-1}(z)\left|\zeta(z)\right\rangle .\label{eq:dzg sol 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since all the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

 are positive and all the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\zeta\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are nonnegative as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)>0$
\end_inset

, it follows that all the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are strictly positive.
 Equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)>0$
\end_inset

 for sufficiently small 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

, and it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)$
\end_inset

 will remain positive for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

 are strictly increasing functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for all those 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)$
\end_inset

 are bounded from above.
 To see this, consider the relationship 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle u^{0}\right|\hat{M}=\lambda_{0}\left\langle u^{0}\right|,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 written in components as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{j}^{0}(z)\left[\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;j)-\kappa_{j\rightarrow j}\right]-\sum_{i\neq j}u_{i}^{0}(z)z\kappa_{i\rightarrow j}=\lambda_{0}u_{j}^{0}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since all the components 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}^{0}$
\end_inset

 are strictly positive (as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

), it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;j)-\kappa_{j\rightarrow j}>0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and hence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(z;j)<\left(\nu\kappa_{j\rightarrow j}\right)^{-\frac{\nu}{\nu-1}}<\frac{1}{\nu^{\frac{\nu}{\nu-1}}}\approx\frac{1}{\nu}.\label{eq:gz less 1 over nu}

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 monotonically decreases as 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 grows.
 This follows from the perturbation theory formula for nondegenerate eigenvalues
, which allows us to express 
\begin_inset Formula $d\lambda_{0}/dz$
\end_inset

 as a matrix product with normalized left and right eigenvectors, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\lambda_{0}(z)}{dz}=\left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|\frac{d\hat{M}}{dz}\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle .\label{eq:dlambda dz}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As we have just shown, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)$
\end_inset

 grows with growing 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $d\hat{M}/dz$
\end_inset

 is a matrix with all nonpositive elements.
 Since the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle u^{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|v^{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 have strictly positive components while at least 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 matrix elements of the nonpositive matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $d\hat{M}/dz$
\end_inset

 are strictly negative, we obtain the strict inequality
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\lambda_{0}(z)}{dz}=\left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|\frac{d\hat{M}}{dz}\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle <0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, we can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 monotonically decreases with 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dz}\det\hat{M}(z)=\bigl(\det\hat{M}(z)\bigr)\text{Tr}\bigl(\hat{M}^{-1}\frac{d\hat{M}}{dz}\bigr)<0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

since it was already found that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}(z)$
\end_inset

 has all positive elements while 
\begin_inset Formula $d\hat{M}/dz$
\end_inset

 has all nonpositive elements.
 However, the monotonic decrease alone of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 and of 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 is not yet sufficient to establish that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 actually becomes singular at some finite 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.

The results derived so far — the monotonic behavior of

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, the bounds on

\end_inset

 — hold for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 Now we will show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$

 cannot remain positive for all real

 We can rewrite Eq.

\begin_inset Formula

z\sum_{i\neq k}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}g(z;i)=g^{\frac{1}{\nu}}(z;k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}g(z;k).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Using the property 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)>0$
\end_inset

 and the bound
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z=\frac{g^{\frac{1}{\nu}}(z;k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}g(z;k)}{\sum_{i\not\in T,i\neq k}\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}g(z;i)+\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}}<\frac{g^{\frac{1}{\nu}}(z;k)}{\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}}<\frac{\nu^{1-\nu}}{\kappa_{k\rightarrow T}}.\label{eq:z global bound}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In other words, no real-valued solutions of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) exist for larger 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 Let us then show that an upper bound on 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 contradicts the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 We know that there exists a real-valued solution branch 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $0<g(z;j)<\infty$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\partial_{z}g(z;j)<\infty$
\end_inset

 for all those 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

 for which this solution branch remains real-valued.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 can be viewed as a solution of a differential equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}g(z;j)=\left|\partial_{z}g\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with continuous coefficients and everywhere positive right-hand side.
 The solution of such differential equations, if bounded, will exist for
 all 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, if the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;j)$
\end_inset

 existed only up to some 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{1})>0$
\end_inset

 and hence a finite value 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z_{1};j)>0$

\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}\hat{M}(z)$

\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;k)$

 is increasing (by assumption) for all

\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}M_{kk}$

 can be bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z^{-1}M_{kk}=\frac{1}{z}\left[\frac{1}{\nu}g^{\frac{1}{\nu}-1}(z;k)-\kappa_{k\rightarrow k}\right]<\frac{C_{0}}{z}\label{eq:diag deviation}

\end_inset

with a suitable constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}>0$
\end_inset

 for all sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The off-diagonal elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-independent, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z^{-1}M_{ki}=-\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, for sufficiently large 
\begin_inset Formula $z>0$
\end_inset

 the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}M_{ki}$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B_{ki}\equiv-\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}\left[1-\delta_{ki}\right],

\end_inset

that is, a matrix that has zeros on the diagonal and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{k\rightarrow i}$
\end_inset

 off the diagonal.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $-B_{ki}$
\end_inset

 is nonnegative and, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, has a real, positive
 eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}>0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 has a real, negative eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $-\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 The deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing large enough 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 because the constant

\end_inset

 in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $z$

 Hence, the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}M_{ki}$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily close to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\beta_{0}<0$
\end_inset

; in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{-1}\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 has at least one real negative eigenvalue for all sufficiently large

 This contradicts the initial assumption that

 We again restrict our attention to the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z<z_{*}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)>0$
\end_inset

.
 For these 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 we expand 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$

 in Taylor series and express the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z_{*})\equiv0$

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0=\lambda_{0}(z_{*})=\lambda_{0}(z)+\frac{d\lambda_{0}(z)}{dz}\left(z_{*}-z\right)+O[(z_{*}-z)^{2}],

hence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\lambda_{0}(z)}{dz}=-\frac{\lambda_{0}(z)}{z_{*}-z}+O(z_{*}-z).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We then use Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $d\lambda_{0}/dz$

 in another way,
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{d\lambda_{0}(z)}{dz} & =\left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|\frac{d}{dz}\hat{M}(z)\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle \nonumber \\

\end{align}

\end_inset

where in the second line we interpreted 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}(z)$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{r}$
\end_inset

 variables 
\begin_inset Formula $g(z;i)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z$

\begin_inset Formula $d/dz$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial z$
\end_inset

.
 Using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda_{0}(z)}{z-z_{*}}\approx\left\langle u^{0}(z)\right|\negmedspace\left[\negmedspace\sum_{i,k}\frac{\partial\hat{M}}{\partial g(z;i)}\hat{M}_{ik}^{-1}\zeta_{k}+\frac{\partial\hat{M}(z)}{\partial z}\right]\negmedspace\left|v^{0}(z)\right\rangle .\label{eq:lambda rel 0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since we are only interested in the qualitative behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}(z)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$
\end_inset

, we do not need to keep track of the complicated coefficients in Eq.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}^{-1}(z)\approx\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}(z)}\left|v^{0}\right\rangle \left\langle u^{0}\right|+O(1),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

so the dominant singular terms in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $z=z_{*}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\lambda_{0}(z)}{z_{*}-z}\approx\frac{C_{1}}{\lambda_{0}(z)}+O(1).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{0}(z)=c_{1}\sqrt{z_{*}-z}+O(z_{*}-z).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The positivity of

 for

Conclusion

\begin_layout Standard
In this book I have explored the problem of extracting observational consequence
s from inflationary models with spatial variation of the physical constants
 in the universe.
 The approach was based on the version of the anthropic principle proposed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Vilenkin:1995yd"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The main issue in this line of work is to construct a well-motivated prescripti
on for a measure on a multiverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models of inflation are generically future-eternal in that inflation never
 ends globally (Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Eternal-inflation"

\end_inset

).
 Much of the work is performed in the context of inflation driven by a hypotheti
cal scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (the inflaton), as is currently observationally favored.
 A second much researched cosmological scenario is the so called string-theoreti
c landscape where the vacuum state of fields is metastable.
 Transitions between vacua can proceed via bubble nucleation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stochastic description of inflation based on Fokker–Planck equations

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Stochastic approach"

\end_inset

.
 I explain the main properties of the stochastic approach and also give
 an introduction to the stochastic description of the string-theoretic landscape
 using the master equation.
 These mathematical tools allow one to obtain a concrete stochastic process
 representing eternal inflation and to study its properties quantitatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I give a broad overview of the currently present measure proposals in Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Predictions-and-cutoffs"

\end_inset

.
 In all the measure proposals, the infinite volume of the multiverse is
 cut off in a controlled manner.
 However, the measures differ in the specific implementation of the volume
 cutoff and in the way the volume approaches infinity when the cutoff is
 removed.
 The existing measure prescriptions can be categorized into volume-based
 and worldline-based.
 I characterize these prescriptions from a physical standpoint and explain
 their main features.
 The volume-based measures compute the observation of a randomly situated
 observer in a global infinite multiverse, and are suitable for predicting
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cosmological
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conditions, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

external conditions found on first observation.
 The worldline-based measures are suitable for sending a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

message to the future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 containing information about the expected cosmological conditions in the
 future given the knowledge of the present conditions.
 Since the message can be opened only by observers near the message box,
 the worldline selects the correct statistical ensemble of observers.
 In this way I show that the two classes of measures look for answers to
 very different physical questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I proceed to present a new multiverse measure proposal — the RV measure
 (Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:A-new-measure-for"

\end_inset

).
 The RV measure is based on the construction of an ensemble of finite multiverse
s, which can be visualized as a cutoff in probability space, rather than
 a geometric cutoff in the real spacetime.
 This is an attractive feature of the RV proposal since no arbitrarily chosen
 geometric constructions need to be used.

\begin_layout Standard

 and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:The-new-measure-for-landscape"

\end_inset

 develop a mathematical framework for the technically difficult analysis
 of the probability distributions of observables in the RV cutoff.
 There are two main contexts in which the RV cutoff is applied: the slow-roll
 inflation driven by a scalar field, and the landscape of string theory.
 In both contexts I show by rigorous methods that the RV cutoff is well-defined
 and independent of the choice of initial conditions at the beginning of
 inflation.
 For slow-roll inflation I derive formulas that are suitable for direct
 numerical calculations.
 For the landscape, I derive an analytic expression for relative bubble
 abundances of low-energy vacua.
 I also perform explicit analytic calculations for a toy model of slow-roll
 inflation and for several toy models of the landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These calculations confirm that the RV measure has the desirable properties
 expected of a volume-based measure: coordinate invariance, independence
 of initial conditions, and the absence of the youngness paradox.
 A calculation for a general landscape also shows that the RV measure does
 not suffer from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boltzmann brain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem.
 Thus the RV measure is a promising solution to the long-standing problem
 of obtaining probabilities in models of eternal inflation.
 Ultimately, the viability of the RV measure proposal will depend on its
 performance in various example cases.
 In the calculations performed so far, it is found that RV measure yields
 results that do not always coincide with the results of any other measure
 proposal.
 Hence, the RV measure is not equivalent to any of the earlier proposals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An extension of the RV measure to landscape scenarios can be achieved in
 several ways.
 In Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:RV-cutoff-for-landscape"

\end_inset

 I considered the set of all possible future evolutions of a single nonterminal
 bubble and defined the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{N}$
\end_inset

 of evolutions yielding a finite total number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of 
\emph on
terminal
\emph default
 bubbles.
 In Sec.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Extending-the-RV"

\end_inset

 I used the ensemble of evolutions with a finite total number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of daughter bubbles (of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 types).
 One could also consider the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{N}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 of evolutions yielding a finite total number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of 
\emph on
observers
\emph default
 in bubbles of all types.
 After computing the distribution of some desired quantity by counting the
 observations made within the finite set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 bubbles (or observers), the cutoff parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 can be increased to infinity.
 It remains to be seen whether the limit distributions are different for
 differently defined ensembles, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{N}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, and if so, which definition is more suitable.
 Future work will show whether some extension of the RV measure can provide
 a satisfactory answer to the problem of predictions in eternal inflation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude, the present work demonstrates that the RV measure has attractive
 features and may be considered a viable candidate for the solution of the
 measure problem in multiverse cosmology.
 More work is needed to investigate the dependence of the predictions on
 the precise details of the definition of the ensemble 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 I have developed an extensive mathematical framework for the calculations
 in the RV prescription and obtained first results for specific landscapes.
 However, a more powerful approximation scheme is desirable so that the
 predictions of the RV measure can be more easily obtained for landscapes
 of general type.
 Ultimately, the viability of the RV measure is to be judged by its predictions
 for cosmological observables in realistic landscapes.
 These issues are topics for future research.

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially
 or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,
 and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are
 reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever
 to those of this License.
 You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or
 further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
 However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
 If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
 the conditions in section

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
 covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
 notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that
 carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on
 the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
 Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
 of these copies.
 The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
 equally prominent and visible.
 You may add other material on the covers in addition.
 Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the
 title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
 copying in other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
 you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
 actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
 than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along
 with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
 location from which the general network-using public has access to download
 using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of
 the Document, free of added material.
 If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
 you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
 Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
 at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
 or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
 well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
 to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
 License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
 licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
 possesses a copy of it.
 In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
A.
 Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
 that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
 if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
 You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher
 of that version gives permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
B.
 List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible
 for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with
 at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
 authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this
 requirement.

 Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
 in the previous sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
J.
 Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
 that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
 the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
 as invariant.
 To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
 Version's license notice.
 These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may add a section Entitled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Endorsements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version
 by various parties – for example, statements of peer review or that the
 text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
 of a standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
 of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
 Texts in the Modified Version.
 Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
 added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.
 If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously
 added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
 behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on
 explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
 permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorseme

\begin_layout Subsection*

\size tiny
Combining documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
 under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
 that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all
 of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections
 of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
 their Warranty Disclaimers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
 identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
 If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
 contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
 of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
 that section if known, or else a unique number.
 Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
 Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in
 the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”;
 likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections
 Entitled “Dedications”.
 You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\size tiny
Collections of documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
 released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
 License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
 the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
 verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
 it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
 License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
 respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\size tiny
Aggregation with independent works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
 independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
 medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilatio
n is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
 what the individual works permit.
 When the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not apply
 to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative
 works of the Document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If the Cover Text requirement of section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:3Copying-in-quantity"

\end_inset

 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is
 less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
 may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
 or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
 form.
 Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\size tiny
Translation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
 translations of the Document under the terms of section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:4Modifications"

\end_inset

.
 Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
 from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some
 or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
 Invariant Sections.
 You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices
 in the Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also include
 the original English version of this License and the original versions
 of those notices and disclaimers.
 In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
 of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”,
 or “History”, the requirement (section
\begin_inset space ~

) to Preserve its Title (section
\begin_inset space ~

Termination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size tiny
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
 as expressly provided for under this License.
 Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.
