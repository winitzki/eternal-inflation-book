# "Eternal Inflation" by Sergei Winitzki, Ph.D.

This is the free version of the book "Eternal Inflation" (2009).

This book was published by World Scientific in 2009 under ISBN 978-981-283-239-9.

The copyright was returned to me (the author) in 2018.
I am therefore free to publish this book, without any Word Scientific typography, layout, and only with text written by me.
